Cleaning a messy junk drawer to make everything fit neatly or categorizing a bookshelf presents subtle mental exercises that flex our logical thinking and creativity. A Little to the Left shines a light on these ordinary tasks with dozens of challenges that promote organization and the satisfaction that comes with it, making for a uniquely pleasing experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>A Little to the Left\u2019s puzzles present tasks as simple as arranging pencils by height or stacking spoons by size. These bite-sized exercises don\u2019t always make me sweat, but I enjoy the tactile sensation of, say, clicking and dragging bits of crumbs away from a dining table to create a clean surface for setting plates. If you find pleasure in even the simplest forms of tidying, you\u2019ll likely sink into this game right away, and this intangible x-factor makes the experience satisfying.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/players.brightcove.net\/694940074001\/rydylbNsz_default\/index.html?videoId=6315174297112\"><\/iframe>\n\n<p>Some puzzles have multiple answers. For example, you can arrange books by height or thickness, and I liked finding two or three alternative solutions to a straightforward problem I wouldn\u2019t normally consider. Eventually, things get a bit more complicated. What\u2019s the best way to arrange spice shakers with different amounts and color patterns? What time should I wind a clock\u2019s hands to have the shadows align a certain way? These harder conundrums give the game a nice bite, and I find most solutions clever; at best, I walk away feeling part Marie Kondo, part Einstein. But some problems feel too open-ended in their answers.<\/p>\n\n<p>When, for example, arranging piles of disparate shells or leaves to form a hidden pattern, I\u2019ll stare at the screen for long periods wondering what the heck I was supposed to do. Every puzzle has some logic, and tinkering eventually leads to a breakthrough, but sometimes I still didn\u2019t grasp the problem even after solving it. That\u2019s probably more of a \u201cme\u201d issue; I vibe best with less abstract puzzles, like finding the optimal way to hang tools on a nail board. However, others require objects placed a bit too precisely. While tilting picture frames on a wall, I fiddled with one for way too long before, to my annoyance, it randomly settled on a pixel-perfect angle I\u2019d covered numerous times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The game\u2019s inventive hint system, where you manually erase an obscuring doodle to reveal a puzzle's correct configuration, is cute and can be helpful, but it has flaws. For one, I usually only wanted to expose a specific piece of the puzzle, so erasing the section I needed required careful precision to avoid showing too much. Since hints are in black and white, color-based answers don\u2019t translate as well. Ultimately, simply looking at the solution isn\u2019t the same as understanding it, making me wish the game presented hints with more direct guidance. Thankfully, A Little to the Left doesn\u2019t require you to finish a puzzle to move on (at least for most of it). Selecting \u201cLet It Be\u201d lets you skip segments without consequence if they prove too tough or simply aren\u2019t as fun. The game wants you to think, but not at the expense of its relaxing atmosphere.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/08\/f4ebf947\/alttl_1.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/08\/af7475a0\/alttl_6.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/08\/4633c45c\/alttl_7.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/08\/3dc76cd3\/alttl_3.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/08\/3685e1ad\/alttl_2.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/08\/d1315786\/alttl_4.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          &nbsp;\n\n<p>A Little to the Left provides a good mental jumpstart to my day, so I appreciate the Daily Tidy.
