However, you can only play a certain amount of cards each turn based on how many Beats (basically mana points) they require. You don\u2019t build your deck; instead, you have a permanent selection of general-use cards with Ooblets bringing unique abilities, thus dictating your line-up. One Ooblet burdens the opponent\u2019s deck with useless cards, another focuses on weakening their attack power, while others raise your card\u2019s power by generating Hype.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Despite the strategic elements, dance battles are a walk in the park. I never lost one in over 30 hours of playing, and it never mattered what combination of Ooblets I used since the A.I. rarely plays aggressively. I wish dance battles challenged me more because they became an uninteresting formality, especially during quests where you must complete multiple bouts in a row. However, I respect the battle system as a cute, non-violent introduction to turn-based combat for younger or inexperienced players.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, the bulk of the experience unfolds on your farm. In addition to growing new Ooblets, you cultivate crops by plowing land and keeping it watered. This became my favorite part of Ooblets. I enjoyed designing my farm and concocting systems to produce crops as optimally as possible (which sometimes takes days). It gets even better once you construct tools to make the job more autonomous, such as automatic sprinklers. You can also assign extra Ooblets to your farm to tend to responsibilities like pulling weeds or harvesting the ripe yield while you\u2019re away, providing a nice incentive to obtain as many of these little helpers as possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/09\/fe7dfc90\/ooblets_farm_3.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/09\/a99f83d7\/ooblets_rain.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/08\/31\/5a633152\/ooblets_farming.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/08\/31\/edef2579\/ooblets_mamoonia.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/08\/04\/b31c79f9\/ooblets_dance_battle.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          &nbsp;\n\n<p>Farming crops and gathering materials, whether plucking them from the earth, fishing them out of the sea, or recycling them out of trash, is pivotal to Ooblet\u2019s progression. Every major task requires players to deliver bundles of materials, whether you\u2019re restoring Badgetown\u2019s clubhouses, repairing a hot air balloon to travel to new cities, or fulfilling a ton of fetch quests. Having a bit of everything on you at all times matters; you can\u2019t even challenge Ooblets to dance battles unless you\u2019re carrying a specific crop or a dish made from them. Running into new Ooblets loses its excitement when they require a vegetable you left in storage, forcing you to trek back home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Quests began to lose their appeal once I realized they\u2019re the same, sometimes lengthy, exercise of growing or scavenging materials. This often left me at the mercy of meters and the clock, creating stretches where I meandered with few substantial options until a vital resource sprouted or replenished itself. Additionally, these progression roadblocks sometimes go overboard. One campaign mission required me to grind hundreds of precious Gummies, the game\u2019s currency, to pay an arcade hacker. Another job repeatedly forced me to climb up and down a mountain path gated by NPCs whose requests could only be satisfied by returning home. Having some tasks rewarded with Wishies, a secondary currency spent on upgrades, helps but it\u2019s not enough.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Other elements and activities don\u2019t entirely click either. Running a shop feels needlessly tedious since batches of items can only be sold in single quantities, making restocking a hassle. Making the rounds to chat up the same group of citizens each day to build friendship meters, which unlock decent rewards, also loses its appeal. I began to avoid the Dance Barn, which hosts dance battle tournaments to win a daily prize, due to my boredom with the combat. Locations beyond Badgetown offer little incentive to revisit them once you wrap up their campaign quests, outside of collecting missing Ooblets.
