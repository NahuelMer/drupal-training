After building an army of super soldiers as weapons of war, the authoritarians unwittingly seal their own fates by bringing online the ninja warrior known as Moonrider.

Across multiple runs, players choose different paths from rift to rift and develop an uneasy alliance with Fai, the strange, sardonic artificial intelligence whose spacecraft created the rifts.
