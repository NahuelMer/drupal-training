To do this, she must solve puzzles with her A.I.-powered gun, Astra, to charge the station with entropy so that its time-reversing device can stop Earth\u2019s apocalyptic calamity from ever happening in the first place.

You place these cubes on pads to power up elevators or open gates. Some cubes don\u2019t do anything on their own. Others act as jump pads to help you reach high-up platforms or as bridges to help you cross gaps. The Entropy Centre continues to dole out new types of cubes throughout the 15-hour experience, and I met each with enthusiasm to see how it might rearrange my mind\u2019s puzzle-solving toolbox. The cubes alone won\u2019t reveal your solution, though \u2013 you need Astra. This gun can turn back time on an individual object by 38.1 seconds and as a result, every obstacle becomes one where you must first envision how a sequence of events must play out and then reverse it in your head so that you know exactly how to set it up. To put it simply, solving a puzzle in The Entropy Centre requires that you determine where you need to end up and work backwards to find the beginning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/players.brightcove.net\/694940074001\/rydylbNsz_default\/index.html?videoId=6311006021112\"><\/iframe>\n\n<p>By the end, I was solving puzzles using multiple cubes, all of which did different things, and feeling like a genius as I watched various time-reversing paths place everything exactly where I needed them. It hurt my brain at first \u2013 a lot \u2013 but I quickly learned the rules by which The Entropy Centre worked, and I was delighted to find an entirely new type of puzzle as a result.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Occasionally, I\u2019d lose five minutes of progress because a cube would disappear into a wall, causing me to restart the entire sequence. Nothing was more frustrating than watching a cube glitch into the wall before disappearing entirely. The game also crashed entirely on me a few times. Ultimately, though, the satisfaction that solving each puzzle gave me outweighed the frustrations I experienced.<\/p>\n\n<p>With The Entropy Centre behind me, I\u2019m fascinated by what Stubby Games accomplished with its debut. It\u2019s full of excellent puzzles, but the stuff around them, like bugs and narrative pacing, stop the entire package from coming together in an equally impressive way. Despite the exhaustion I felt as the credits rolled, I\u2019m stoked The Entropy Centre exists. It brings something unique and new to the genre, and I hope Stubby Games continues to iterate on that in a sequel, spin-off, or spiritual successor. It\u2019s not every day a game shows me something I\u2019ve never seen before that it also happens to nail, and what The Entropy Centre does well is worth pushing through its long narrative to ensure you see every trick up its sleeve.<\/p>\n  \n\n    <h2>Score:\n    8<\/h2>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/scoring\" target=\"_blank\">About Game Informer's review system<\/a>\n  <\/p>\n\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/node\/118976?purchasefromrss\" target=\"_blank\">Purchase<\/a>\n  <\/p>\n","description":"\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n\n\n\n      <p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/02\/1c5026fe\/the_entropy_centre.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" alt=\"The Entropy Centre review stubby games impressions puzzle gameplay\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" \/><\/p>\n\n  <p>\n              <b>Reviewed on:<\/b>\n      PC\n      <br \/>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <b>Platform:<\/b>\n      PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X\/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC\n      <br \/>\n                  <b>Publisher:<\/b>\n      Playstack Ltd\n      <br \/>\n              <b>Developer:<\/b>\n      Stubby Games\n      <br \/>\n                  <b>Rating:<\/b>\n      Everyone 10+\n      <\/p>\n\n      <p>I don\u2019t envy the developers of puzzle games.
