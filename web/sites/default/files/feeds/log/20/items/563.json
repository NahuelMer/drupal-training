If you like Trivium, Lamb of God, and other bands like this in the genre and guns with a fiery kick, Metal: Hellsinger is already worth the price of admission. I gunned down a massive skeletal boss to the beat of a near-operatic song backed by iconic vocals from System of a Down\u2019s Serj Tankian. I ripped through hordes of enemy mobs and behemoth demons to the rhythm of Arch Enemy\u2019s Alissa White-Gluz\u2019s death-metal melodies.

Streaks increase your damage output and score modifier. What\u2019s unique about this streak counter is that each new level adds a new layer to the music track. At 2x, you might hear a bass rumbling and a guitar\u2019s subtle whine, rearing for what\u2019s to come. At 4x, the drums might kick in.
