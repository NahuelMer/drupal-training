Puzzles expertly mix up the pace between combat encounters, and I was constantly impressed with how there always seemed to be story context for engaging in the video game parts. When ignoring the main task to find treasure chests, for example, Atreus would always take time to explain to the new characters that his dad likes loot. Despite the urgency of the story, Mimir would often make sure to state that we can take our time and explore if we want to. These little moments and bits of dialogue showcase Sony Santa Monica fully understands how its players want to interact with its game, and I was always thankful for that understanding.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nConsidering the player at every moment extends to the exceptional level design, as well. Whether visiting new versions of old locations or entirely new realms, each area wraps around itself to reveal shortcuts, or bypasses the need to backtrack. The well-designed combat arenas feature multiple levels to fight on and environmental attack options, like grabbing a giant rock to fling at that particularly pesky lizard. Even the way the player camera moves to hint at optional chests or tease new paths is impressive and consistent. The players\u2019 direction is always considered.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nGod of War Ragnar\u00f6k feels a lot like God of War (2018), which is a compliment considering how fantastic that game is. Sony Santa Monica was right to not break what wasn\u2019t broken and it has expertly continued the story threads that were left hanging from the previous game. Any complaints about the overall experience (familiar combat, collecting and leveling up equipment isn\u2019t particularly interesting) are quickly forgotten in the face of the compelling narrative, believable character relationships, and incredible visuals and animation. Even from its early PlayStation 2 days, the God of War series has always set a high, quality bar for itself, and with few exceptions, it manages to leap above that bar. God of War Ragnar\u00f6k is no different.<\/p>\n  \n\n      <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/scoring\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"gi-must-play\" src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/2022\/02\/24\/fb77bb22\/mustplay_badge_rgb_tiny.jpg\" height=\"50\" width=\"39\" alt=\"GI Must Play\" \/><\/a>\n    <h2>Score:\n    9.5<\/h2>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/scoring\" target=\"_blank\">About Game Informer's review system<\/a>\n  <\/p>\n\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/node\/111208?purchasefromrss\" target=\"_blank\">Purchase<\/a>\n  <\/p>\n","description":"\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n\n\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/thumbnail\/public\/2022\/11\/01\/a45ca8f1\/agowr_preview_screenshot_02.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"Image\" class=\"image-style-thumbnail\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n                                    <p><iframe frameborder='0' width='560' height='315' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/i_67Bvtrz58'\/><\/iframe><\/p>\n      \n  <p>\n              <b>Reviewed on:<\/b>\n      PlayStation 5\n      <br \/>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <b>Platform:<\/b>\n      PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4\n      <br \/>\n                  <b>Publisher:<\/b>\n      PlayStation Studios\n      <br \/>\n              <b>Developer:<\/b>\n      Santa Monica Studio\n      <br \/>\n                  <b>Rating:<\/b>\n      Mature\n      <\/p>\n\n      <p>To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice.

In some cases, I completed side stories with big, important moments and only learned they had been optional afterward.<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/ff97e20e\/gowr_preview_screenshot_08.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/5ae93b71\/gowr_preview_screenshot_09.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/3fe17635\/gowr_preview_screenshot_10.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/16cbbade\/gowr_preview_screenshot_11.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/a28cb14f\/gowr_preview_screenshot_01.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/a3010852\/gowr_preview_screenshot_12.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/e7e7cf29\/gowr_preview_screenshot_02.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/535fbf8c\/gowr_preview_screenshot_13.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/73cd83fc\/gowr_preview_screenshot_03.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/164c2d36\/gowr_preview_screenshot_14.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/3c254b3b\/gowr_preview_screenshot_04.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/b38eba37\/gowr_preview_screenshot_15.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/d56eb032\/gowr_preview_screenshot_05.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/8d5f2333\/gowr_preview_screenshot_16.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/98a91222\/gowr_preview_screenshot_06.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/e77c4ce5\/gowr_preview_screenshot_17.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/8aea8c53\/gowr_preview_screenshot_07.jpeg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/20\/a42e3a58\/gowr_preview_screenshot_18.jpeg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          \u00a0\n\n<p>Ragnar\u00f6k, despite its fantastic setting, does feature a grounded tone thanks to its splendid performances and fully realized characters, but it is not afraid to be a fun video game. Puzzles expertly mix up the pace between combat encounters, and I was constantly impressed with how there always seemed to be story context for engaging in the video game parts. When ignoring the main task to find treasure chests, for example, Atreus would always take time to explain to the new characters that his dad likes loot. Despite the urgency of the story, Mimir would often make sure to state that we can take our time and explore if we want to. These little moments and bits of dialogue showcase Sony Santa Monica fully understands how its players want to interact with its game, and I was always thankful for that understanding.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nConsidering the player at every moment extends to the exceptional level design, as well. Whether visiting new versions of old locations or entirely new realms, each area wraps around itself to reveal shortcuts, or bypasses the need to backtrack. The well-designed combat arenas feature multiple levels to fight on and environmental attack options, like grabbing a giant rock to fling at that particularly pesky lizard. Even the way the player camera moves to hint at optional chests or tease new paths is impressive and consistent. The players\u2019 direction is always considered.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nGod of War Ragnar\u00f6k feels a lot like God of War (2018), which is a compliment considering how fantastic that game is. Sony Santa Monica was right to not break what wasn\u2019t broken and it has expertly continued the story threads that were left hanging from the previous game. Any complaints about the overall experience (familiar combat, collecting and leveling up equipment isn\u2019t particularly interesting) are quickly forgotten in the face of the compelling narrative, believable character relationships, and incredible visuals and animation. Even from its early PlayStation 2 days, the God of War series has always set a high, quality bar for itself, and with few exceptions, it manages to leap above that bar. God of War Ragnar\u00f6k is no different.<\/p>\n  \n\n      <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/scoring\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"gi-must-play\" src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/2022\/02\/24\/fb77bb22\/mustplay_badge_rgb_tiny.jpg\" height=\"50\" width=\"39\" alt=\"GI Must Play\" \/><\/a>\n    <h2>Score:\n    9.5<\/h2>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/scoring\" target=\"_blank\">About Game Informer's review system<\/a>\n  <\/p>\n\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/node\/111208?purchasefromrss\" target=\"_blank\">Purchase<\/a>\n  <\/p>\n","author_name":"Kyle Hilliard","timestamp":1667491200,"updated":1667491200,"url":"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/review\/god-of-war-ragnarok\/next-to-godliness","guid":"119425","tags":[],"geolocations":null,"enclosures":null,"feed_title":"Game Informer Reviews","feed_description":"From the biggest triple-A releases to cult indie hits, Game Informer reviews identify which games are worth your time.","feed_url":"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/","author_email":""}
