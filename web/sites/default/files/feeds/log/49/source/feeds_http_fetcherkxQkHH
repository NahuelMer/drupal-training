      PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation VR2, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC
      &lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;b&gt;Publisher:&lt;/b&gt;
      Cygnus Entertainment
      &lt;br /&gt;
              &lt;b&gt;Developer:&lt;/b&gt;
      Cygnus Entertainment
      &lt;br /&gt;
              &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The story of Sierra Entertainment is as timeless as its catalog, which includes multiple influential game changers. Iconic titles like Phantasmagoria and King’s Quest unlocked the code of possibilities for both developers and players, proving anything in your imagination can materialize in a video game. The ideas and dreams of Roberta and Ken Williams influenced so much of game development and publishing that it feels like a gift from the past to receive a 3D re-interpretation of a black-and-white text adventure game that ultimately gave life to Sierra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original title, 1976’s Colossal Cave Adventure, is already one of the most influential games ever, but Roberta and Ken interrupting 25 years of retirement to transform a text adventure into a brand-new experience is as inspiring as it is exciting. This new version of Colossal Cave is one of the most articulated text adventure games, a style it retains despite the new magical realism and storybook art style. A journey that takes place across the mysterious caverns buried beneath a seemingly isolated island, Colossal Cave remains powered by the text adventure playset tools and rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6319558009112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to separate the 47 years of distance between the two titles. Colossal Cave Adventure may as well be the bedrock in which the 2023 release is carved, but Colossal Cave is an exciting adventure waiting to be had by anyone okay with the dust and debris from all the game design excavations. You’re still solving text adventure problems but with intuitive controls, ambient music and sound effects, and a lantern of 3D graphics to light and guide your path.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring the caves and isolated island above is a colorful journey full of treasure, magic, and wonder. Players are tasked with achieving the highest point total (of a possible 350) by collecting special treasures while uncovering the secrets and mysteries underneath the eponymous cave. Like the original, you’re likely to regularly get lost while utilizing trial-and-error tactics to find the next treasure or way forward. It always feels like you’re three steps behind, but with enough time and walking, you’ll eventually find your way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colossal Cave has players climbing ladders, opening doors, and, yes, even battling a dragon, all while completing as many crucial actions as possible. Colossal Cave retains a classic adventure game bump in that situations, characters, and items don’t always work intuitively, making it a test of patience for any stranded explorers. Though piecing the puzzles together can be confusing, I always felt properly rewarded and excited when I finally found the solutions. Seeing a massive, hissing snake vanish after completing one puzzle was a thrill. However, with little instruction or hint toward the solution, it took me a frustratingly long time to realize I needed to drop my recently acquired Black Wand before I could proceed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an age of having nearly every objective displayed on a HUD, it was refreshing to walk down the streams and through the darkness of Colossal Cave. I didn’t always know where to go or what to do, but I kept exploring and playing. I found myself lost a lot, but I always managed to find a weird item or path forward that gave me enough to continue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;For all its charm and flaws, Colossal Cave is a warm “Sierra” passion project that takes you to a simpler time when you were just dropped into a game with only an idea of what’s to come. All you know is what you’re told at the start: You’re exploring a cavern to see sights and collect treasure. It’s only at the end that you learn about the cute frame narrative wrappings. Exploring and finding treasure is fun nonetheless, but Colossal Cave tucks some immersive sim elements that add just a little more mystery at the end of the tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cygnus made Colossal Cave with VR in mind, but playing it outside VR sacrifices little. The sound effects, ambient noise, and graphics all meet at the perfect intersection for technological compromises and art style. This should help the title remain even more timeless than the original adventure from all those years ago.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colossal Cave isn’t for everyone, but it’s like a slow and meticulously designed theme park ride, all built around an old text adventure game, making for a fascinating experience. Whether you play it or not is probably more up to your personal sensibilities, but Colossal Cave remains an immersive excavation that’s more than worth the trip, even with all the old screws and rusty bolts binding the two periods of game history together.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake feels like a game of yesteryear, in both good and bad ways. It’s a nostalgic romp through themed levels that feel more inspired than just another platforming tour through Bikini Bottom. It does a great job highlighting why people that grew up with SpongeBob SquarePants loved the show, and why people still love it today. At its best, the gameplay is decently fun, but at its worst, it’s mindlessly dull. This, coupled with a few bugs, like one that caused music to disappear completely, or the three hard crashes I experienced, keep this sponge’s latest adventure from going beyond anything more than average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mermaid fortune teller Kassandra is in Bikini Bottom, and she gives SpongeBob and Patrick a vial of magical bubble soap that cracks open the underwater multiverse, bringing chaos to Bikini Bottom. It’s up to SpongeBob to rescue his friends by visiting various worlds in an effort to restore the city to its former glory. These themed locations take SpongeBob on pirate adventures, to the wild west, medieval times, and more. These levels were among the highlights of my roughly 10 hours with The Cosmic Shake. Purple Lamp does a great job recreating the world of SpongeBob in these themed biomes, and it was neat seeing how different classic characters got on in them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5PjBq95dgyc" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Krabs is a money-hungry corsair in the pirate-themed world, while Mrs. Puff runs the seahorse riding school in the wild west level. That the show’s actors voice these characters adds a premium touch to every interaction. And perhaps ironically, the best writing in the game is the original work by Purple Lamp, with multiple instances that made me laugh out loud (Patrick’s trademark dead-pan naivete being the standout). When Purple Lamp forced specific references to the SpongeBob SquarePants show, though, I grew either bored or outright annoyed at the writing. Hearing SpongeBob sing the Krusty Krab Pizza song, an unironic banger, the first few times was cute, but hearing him sing it randomly while I platform around a Hollywood-esque movie set for the tenth time is anything but. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platforming in The Cosmic Shake starts and ends rudimentary, but I don’t mind it – aimed at children, this level of difficulty feels appropriate. I jump, glide, body slam, and karate kick my way through simple platforming sequences, defeating enemies with an equally rudimentary combat system. I do this using a standard jellyfish-catching net swing, SpongeBob’s body slam, or a karate kick. Combat is unremarkable throughout the game. Unless forced into it, I only defeat who I need to and move on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m not fighting against jelly creatures from the multiverse, I’m collecting jelly scattered around each level and within tiki crates, which I use to purchase one of a couple of dozen costumes, or I’m tracking down gold coins, golden spatulas, or some other item. Getting through each level’s main objectives is a breeze – go here, do this, and fight a boss at the end. But side objectives from various Bikini Bottom residents give reason to jump back into each level to collect more, and it’s here I found the most challenge. I do wish more of this challenge was present in the main objectives, though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purple Lamp showcases a clear adoration for SpongeBob SquarePants, with jokes, deep cuts, and characters that brought me back to my childhood. And when they weren’t forced or overused, they worked well in the narrative. I especially loved hearing that one fish scream about his love of chocolate, and hearing “My leg!” brought me great joy. When The Cosmic Shake is at its best, it sounds, looks, and plays like the kind of game I would have begged my parents to buy me growing up. But when it falters, it’s boring. It’s a game I recommend to fans of SpongeBob SquarePants with ease; for those looking for a great platformer, though, better options lie elsewhere in the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Like a necromorph reanimating the dead, Motive Studios has revived Dead Space and made it stronger and more terrifying than before. This renovation of the 2008 horror classic restores it beyond its original glory. The dismemberment-focused gunplay feels great, it looks even better, and while other noteworthy changes may not feel as substantial as some other remakes, they’re welcomed expansions to the existing template. The result is a remake that faithfully recaptures the magic of its predecessor while amplifying the elements that made it beloved in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDxw4098Qzo" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead Space's story centers on engineer Isaac Clarke joining a small team to answer a distress call from the USG &lt;em&gt;Ishimura&lt;/em&gt;, a massive mining ship designed to “crack” planets and siphon their precious minerals. An outbreak of vicious aliens called necromorphs has ravaged the &lt;em&gt;Ishimura&lt;/em&gt; thanks to their ability to transform corpses into members of its ranks. In addition to stopping this extraterrestrial menace and untangling a conspiracy centering on a theistic cult, Clarke must also uncover the fate of his girlfriend, Nicole, a doctor stationed on the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story from the original is largely intact, but with some key elements either remixed or expanded with greater context based on lore established later in the series. Outside of tightening continuity and adding welcomed background on side characters, these differences don’t dramatically alter the story’s flow or events. The exception is a surprising change to a memorable moment later in the game – a rework that makes more sense in context to the point that I now prefer it over its original incarnation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6313248197112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another prominent narrative difference is that Isaac now talks, voiced by the same performer who brought him to life in the Dead Space sequels. As in those games, the plot benefits from Isaac feeling more like a real person instead of a silent errand boy. Plot twists and revelations hit harder now that he can believably react to them. Motive also did a good job weaving his new dialogue into the existing script, which remains unchanged in most instances. A few performances, though, namely Hammond’s, fall flat in a way that feels preserved from the late 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improved presentation turns Dead Space, already a looker in its day, into a gory feast for the eyes. The &lt;em&gt;Ishimura&lt;/em&gt; and its mutated inhabitants look great, and traversing the blood-stained corridors is even more harrowing thanks to the show-stealing lighting. Whether you’re blanketed in pitch darkness with only your weapon’s flashlight for illumination or basking in the eerily warm glow of planet Aegis VII orbiting outside a window, the lighting serves as the presentational glue that makes this graphical facelift work. The sound design also deserves a shout-out, offering a fair share of devious audio tricks and new hair-raising necromorph groans and screams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat feels familiar, though the reworked controls are more in line with modern third-person games. For example, Issac can run by clicking the analog stick rather than a shoulder button. The trusty plasma cutter and other weapons pack a satisfying punch, especially if you’re using the PlayStation 5’s DualSense features. Dismembering limbs is more satisfying and strategic thanks to the new necromorph damage system, in which layers of skin, muscle, and bone fall apart. This system better showcases the damage and exposes weak points. For example, I loved engulfing enemies using the flamethrower, then pinpointing charred, exposed bones to slice apart with my cutter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wide array of enemy types from the original return in full force, and they're still fun and often challenging to take apart. Using the time-slowing stasis to stop an attack before it connects or using kinesis to pick up and impale necromorphs with stray objects, including their own amputated sharpened limbs, feels as awesome now as it did 14 years ago. It helps that rooms pack more props and environmental weapons to fling around, such as gasoline and stasis tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you finished the original game recently or replayed it enough to intimately know its map, the level design changes probably won’t leap out as suddenly as a necromorph ambush. The &lt;em&gt;Ishimura&lt;/em&gt;'s many rooms and layout remain generally the same, but have been expanded. Most notably, you can access certain areas without riding the tram car. This change helps make the ship feel more organically connected. The tram still exists for those who want to quickly travel between sections necromorph-free. I was lukewarm on some of the zero gravity sections in the original, where you use the suits rockets to propel yourself through weightless, sometimes oxygen-free zones. I can still do without them here, but at least now, those sections adopt the improved control scheme of the sequels to make them feel less like disorienting headaches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now freely revisit areas anytime, but do so at your own peril because necromorphs can still reappear in previously cleared zones. These attacks can be the most startling. Sometimes, I revisited an area, and nothing happened. Other times, I was assaulted in surprisingly new, thoughtfully constructed ways. I love how this system perpetuates Dead Space’s tense and unpredictable design outside the main path, making me second-guess my surroundings no matter how many times I step into them. &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/14/e84bfe52/dead_space_remake_zero_g.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/04/e53fde18/dead-space-media-slide-02-usp-02.jpg.adapt_.1920w.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/04/5281663c/dead-space-media-slide-05-limbs.jpg.adapt_.1920w.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/12/9ecfc86c/dead_space_remake_header.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/12/ef381953/dead_space_remake_promotional.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/04/24a64b66/dead-space-media-slide-03-usp-03.jpg.adapt_.1920w.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;The prize for revisiting areas is often money, weapon upgrade nodes, and precious ammo, all of which can be locked behind tiers of security doors. You’ll also be making these trips to complete the newly added sidequests. There aren’t many of these extra missions, but they generally serve to supplement the lore. One quest delves into the creation of the regenerating Hunter necromorph, for example. Though you’ll largely only find yourself running around the ship’s districts in search of specific audio logs or keys, sidequests add a small but tasty sidedish that extends your unfortunate visit.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than reinvent the wheel, Motive made Dead Space look nicer, play better, and preserved the core of the experience. Its new flourishes add to that enjoyment instead of subtracting. This remake respects and polishes up my memories of Isaac’s first encounter with the necromorphs without making me miss the original version. It also acts as the perfect entry point for newcomers since it feels on par with today’s titles. I hope this exceptional revision signals to EA that Dead Space has plenty of gas in the tank and becomes a harbinger for more horrifying stories in this universe. &lt;/p&gt;

      Matthias Linda
      &lt;br /&gt;
              &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Chained Echoes deceives at first glance, making you question if you missed it back when its seeming contemporaries, like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, were making a big splash. Of course, the reality is this lavish and imaginative RPG is brand new, crafted mostly by a single developer as both an homage to and celebration of those old games, even while injecting a healthy dose of new concepts. The resulting adventure may look like something from 30 years ago, but it plays with a sophistication that deserves attention from any genre fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developer delights in playing with your preconceived ideas. Sometimes, it’s fulfilling those expectations at precisely the pace and moment you are most ready for them, in both story and gameplay, and at other times it’s about subverting them. Ready for a new twist on combat? Here’s a new additional system in which you control mechs in a fascinating alternate combat style, recalling classics like Xenogears. Think you understand the arc of the fated hero storyline? Maybe things are more complicated than you first guessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, the staples of classic JRPG-style adventuring appear in a balanced and rewarding loop. The thoughtfully designed combat system scales back on grindy, repetitive battles. Instead, every fight demands your full attention, leveraging enemy weaknesses, character abilities, on-the-fly party formation changes, and a unique overdrive mechanic to keep your party in the sweet spot of damage dealing. The party fully heals between combat, so it’s always about throwing everything you have at the enemy. Even regular fights sometimes come down to only having one hero standing to strike the final blow. I found the high challenge enjoyable, especially since bad decisions and a game over led to an immediate choice to replay the battle, so the penalty for failure is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upgrade, gear, and leveling systems are all engaging and filled with compelling decisions. Wearing a class emblem can enrich your chosen skills for each character, letting you specialize each hero in powerful ways. Weapons and armor can be improved and tweaked with gems that apply new bonuses, encouraging players to spend time in the menus playing the optimization game. There’s even a fun “Reward Board” that offers precious materials and leveling options for completing specific tasks around the world, encouraging extensive exploration and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/23/c4d4ec84/00.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/23/94f5983c/02_0.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/23/2ea2da84/03_0.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/23/7e08916c/04_0.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/23/3dd56b71/05_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;While playing within the established constraints of the genre, Chained Echoes also tells a mature and nuanced story, touching on themes of fate and free will, recovery from trauma, and the weight of guilt. Those and other tropes have plenty of room for exploration across dozens of hours of available stories and sidequests. Thankfully, it’s an enjoyable fantasy world, filled with unusual species and monsters, intriguing biomes, and a complex geopolitical structure. At times, that last component of political elements can become overwhelming and hard to follow and distracts from the more compelling character drama. But give Chained Echoes enough time, and everything begins to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beautiful throwback musical score is accompanied by pixel-style visuals that relay nostalgia without being a game you’ve played before. Even so, the scope of the narrative and maturity of the character interactions sometimes feels at odds with the retro aesthetic. That incongruity can be a plus, emphasizing moments of terror, war crimes, or betrayals. But at certain dramatic moments, the visual constraints hold the narrative back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chained Echoes has the advantage of decades of distance from the games it looks to for inspiration, it’s a better experience in many instances than those vaunted games from which it arose. I prefer this combat, storytelling, and approach to progression and exploration to many of the JRPGs I grew up so enamored with playing. That’s the highest praise I can heap on a game so removed in time from the games to which it might be compared. Whether you currently count yourself a JRPG connoisseur or fondly recall the ʼ90s heyday of the genre, Chained Echoes is well worth your time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Forspoken is a game about movement and running. Protagonist Frey begins the game running from the law and debt collectors. She's also in the middle of a plan to flee New York City with a gym bag full of cash. Amidst that chaos, she falls into the land of Athia and is eager to leave the new, mysterious world where she inexplicably has superhuman combat and running abilities. Getting from one place to another is Forspoken’s high point, and while no other element quite reaches the heights of how fun running and climbing are, Frey’s adventure isn’t without its highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Forspoken makes a bad first impression. Athia’s environments look great, as does Frey when she moves through the world, but zooming in close for cutscenes shows some rough textures. The dialogue is also underwhelming and the storytelling is overly transparent. From Frey’s cat, Homer, to the little girl who wins Frey’s heart by stealing her phone in Athia, every character’s role as a means to humanize Frey is too obvious, and her frequent and stubborn refusal of the hero’s call is hammered too hard. Thankfully, Forspoken’s story and dialogue improve the deeper you get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tku_2N6yhgc" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end, I liked Frey’s overly vulgar and combative nature and her antagonistic relationship with Cuff, her invisible partner that lives on her wrist. I also enjoyed the zoomed-out main path of the story. None of the twists were particularly surprising, but they were well executed and helped contextualize why Frey is so angry and why she is so insistent on not being the hero, even when everything obviously demanded she moves in that direction. I was also happy with where the game leaves Frey at the end, both from a character relationship perspective and a continued post-game gameplay perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat is consistently mediocre. Forspoken is an action game, but calling it a third-person shooter wouldn't be out of line, as most of Frey’s abilities function like magical guns. Frey has dozens of abilities to swap between on the fly, and taking advantage of enemy vulnerabilities means you're encouraged to do so often. I found a few I preferred, but success often meant switching to the sluggish weapon I didn’t particularly want to use. Changing abilities is convoluted; even late in the game, I had to pause and think about which buttons I needed to hold to access certain weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The handful of bosses Frey encounters is also generally underwhelming. They feature interesting designs and attacks that look great in motion but leave little room for a tactical approach. I mostly just hit them with as many magic bullets as I could. The final boss does encourage some overdue strategy, and that spike in challenge made for my most memorable encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Where the story and general combat are hit-and-miss, movement is excellent throughout. Sprinting through Athia and leaping over buildings feels great, and a handful of additional movement abilities make things even smoother. An early upgrade that lets Frey long jump with well-timed button presses makes her move even faster and smoother. I went out of my way to track down every movement upgrade, and nearly all of them were substantial and fun. That joy of movement integrates into combat, where even if shooting doesn’t feel great, dodging and leaping over enemy heads does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploration is also enjoyable, thanks to a helpful automatic waypoint numbering system. On my way to a core destination, for example, I would mark a handful of locations to check out along the way and wouldn’t have to revert to the map much because of the numbers. Certain locations even allow you to do this by looking out into the distance without entering the map at all. Rewards are worthwhile, too, by offering new cloaks and items and even big stat boosts just for finding particular spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forspoken's story and combat fail to reach the heights of its movement and exploration, but thankfully those two latter elements make up most of the experience. I sprinted, often literally, through the campaign in about 15 hours, and now I have a large world filled with nooks and crannies I'm eager to run through and explore. The narrative won’t linger with me, and I avoided combat in the open world often, but I loved making Frey leap and fly through Athia to discover all its treasure chests and secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

      Everyone
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Everyone has something they loved spending time with in the past – a restaurant, a daily-play video game, a group of friends – only to one day unknowingly enjoy doing so for the final time. It's a poignant and often heartbreaking truth&amp;nbsp;of how places evolve, tastes change, and priorities divert as we all grow older. For the eponymous hero in Lil Gator Game, that activity is live-action role-playing with his big sis. With his sister home from college, Gator assembles a master plan to pry her away from her coursework for one more game. The resulting adventure is a short, cute, Zelda-inspired romp that conjures our own bittersweet nostalgia for the activities, places, and people we once spent our days with but no longer do for one reason or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the play session the protagonist wants to enjoy with his sister, Lil Gator Game draws heavy inspiration from The Legend of Zelda franchise. Though Gator's plan boils down to recruiting friends to decorate and role-play at the playground, it unfolds like a grand adventure. Cardboard cut-outs of fantasy mainstays like slimes, bats, and carnivorous plants populate every corner of the islands, giving you "enemies" to slash down and collect loot from. Though they take on the appearance of these fantasy-adventure baddies, they are inanimate and essentially sword fodder and window dressing. Still, taking them out is satisfying and rewarding as they crumble enjoyably and drop the primary currency for mostly cosmetic items.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/17/dc1c72f0/lgg3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/17/3cd45147/lgg.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/17/f9a278c4/lgg2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/17/d81644b6/lgg5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Exploration is the primary focus of Lil Gator Game, as Gator scours the islands for friends to help him renovate the playground. Gator can climb any surface (complete with an upgradeable stamina bar), swim, jump, and paraglide in search of his fellow anthropomorphic island dwellers. Exploration is often intuitive, boiling down to climbing to the highest area to find the nearest friend, then navigating to them. However, with several places in the picturesque main island appearing similar and no access to a minimap, it's easy to get turned around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you find other animals, they often have a small quest for you to complete before joining your cause. I'm typically not the biggest fetch-quest fan, but these are wholesome and quick enough that I didn't mind them. Quests range from sledding down hills on your shield to helping the other animals play their games; one thematically consistent quest required me to interrupt a mom's work call so she could attend a tea party with her daughter. Each mission you complete adds friends to your playground, paving the way for the next upgrade. Lil Gator Game's handful of main quests require you to recruit high-value animals like a theater troupe or "the cool kids" to join your game, and consist of multiple parts. Though most of the quests are uneventful and repetitive, I loved checking them off my to-do list and adding the NPCs to my playground; I even went back after I rolled credits to recruit the remaining friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6318829247112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you navigate the islands, you also uncover memories from Gator's younger days playing with his sister. These are nothing more than quick monologue drops as Gator stumbles upon areas, but they went a long way to making me feel more invested in the modern-day story. I don't want to spoil the narrative, but it culminates in several endearing meditations on the importance of being present, even as your life changes and your priorities shift. As we get older, the world sets expectations for us, and achieving those expectations often comes at the cost of things we once enjoyed. Nothing lasts forever, and Lil Gator Game reminds us that while it's good to be responsible, we should always maintain that childlike sense of wonder, imagination, and fun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lil Gator Game is as short as it is sweet, with the main story lasting just under five hours, but that's all it needs to be. I loved exploring each nook and cranny of the world during that time for new friends, loot, and memories. By the time the story wrapped up, the game had delivered a poignant and touching message about balancing the important parts of our lives. Lil Gator Game isn't the best Zelda-like I've played, but it's probably the one that will stick with me for the longest.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Fire Emblem Engage Review – Propelling To The Future Using The Past

      &lt;p&gt;Fire Emblem Engage is the mainline follow-up, in name only, to 2019’s excellent Fire Emblem Three Houses. That game’s focus on story, characters, and its expanded social systems helped make it the best-selling in the series, creating new fans of the franchise out of those who had previously watched Fire Emblem flourish from a distance. I was one of those new converts three years ago, and while I was initially concerned if I was a Fire Emblem fan or just a Three Houses fan, Engage has solidified me in the former. Where Three Houses succeeded by emphasizing its larger-than-life heroes and social systems over combat, Engage triumphs in doing the opposite. Engage is a combat-first, everything-else-second strategy RPG, and although its story takes some time to become engrossing, battles are terrific from the jump and only get better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engage’s story begins in a familiar way: A hero saves the world from the Fell Dragon, an evil divinity, and goes into a slumber afterward. They awake 1,000 years later only to discover their battlefield prowess is needed once more. This hero, your protagonist known as the Divine Dragon, must obtain all 12 Engage rings held by neighboring kingdoms. I was never bored by this narrative, but it was simple and often predictable for a large portion of my 50-hour playthrough. The last third of the game’s story further reeled me in with twists, turns, drama, and heart, though, and by the end of my playthrough, I laughed that I had written the story off initially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMGCtrfbZQc" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Engage is more straightforward; it’s a traditional fantasy story about saving the day, and while at times it’s melodramatic, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t all-in on it, especially in the last third. Power Ranger-esque team-up moments left me smiling like a kid again, and I was sad to say goodbye to these characters when the credits began to roll. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engage’s combat is a return to form for the Fire Emblem series, bringing back the traditional rock-paper-scissors formula where lances beat swords, swords beat axes, and axes beat lances, while fisticuff fighters have an advantage over archers, mages, and thieves. It’s a simple fighting premise that works because it forces you to examine unit placement, movement, and strategy well in advance based on enemy positioning on a given map. And this formula is strengthened by a game that builds on the combat in virtually every sense; most everything you do ties back to what happens in battle, including the game’s namesake, Engage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each unit can wear an Emblem Ring, which gives them the ability to Engage or tap into that ring’s power fueled by the soul of a hero from Fire Emblem’s past. This brings series favorites like Marth, Lucina, Roy, Byleth, and more to the game, and while they aren’t the same person as the hero from their original world, they embody them, bringing a heaping dose of nostalgia to Engage for longtime fans.&lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/f496e0fe/fire_emblem_engage1.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;For newer fans who might not realize the excitement behind these returns, the Engage mechanic is still a battlefield boon as it allows the wearer to physically change in appearance, almost embodying the past hero, to become significantly more powerful. When you Engage a unit, they get a special one-time move that usually does extreme damage (or healing), standard attacks are more devastating, some units can move even further, and their ability to dodge or withstand enemy attacks is strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Engage mechanic felt overly powerful in the first half, but was still exciting to use nonetheless. The second half, however, is a stern reminder that strategy is still required in nearly every battle, including the Paralogue side quests, which is where Intelligent Systems really stretches its combat design prowess with challenging map layouts and matchups.&lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/04/24720e7c/engage_2.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;Social systems between units take a backseat to social standings with Emblem Ring heroes mechanically, but strangely, support conversations between units and heroes are short and shallow compared to those that happen between two unit members. Regardless, these conversations serve as small windows into a hero or unit member's personality, unlocked after ranking up to C, B, or A with someone. Like in previous entries, these support conversations aren't a requirement in Engage but are additional flavor for the game's various characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the bond level between a unit and an Emblem Ring hero increases, so do the skills available to purchase. These skills and abilities, like increased luck or avoid, can be equipped for use even when not wearing a given ring. My Divine Dragon can, for example, equip traits from Marth’s ring even if he’s wearing an Emblem Ring of another hero. And even units that you never equip with an Emblem Ring can tap into these skills and abilities thanks to special Emblem bond training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bond rings created by Emblem Ring heroes further expand the possibilities of combat-focused customization. You can create hundreds of bond rings, meld them to strengthen them further, polish Emblem Rings to increase bonds, and so much more. Engage’s various ring mechanics power much of what you’re doing in the game, but it’s also mostly optional. If you want to play it straight, it feels like you can do that in Engage, but if you’re looking for deep customization and optimization, that’s there too, and I appreciate that flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/79f676b6/fire_emblem_engage6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/cc7fa300/fire_emblem_engage7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/e616951e/fire_emblem_engage11.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/4a184d7c/fire_emblem_engage12.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/60ac255a/fire_emblem_engage15.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/f171d965/fire_emblem_engage4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;Ring creation happens at The Somniel, which is Engage’s open hub where virtually everything outside of combat, like cooking, shopping, and more, occurs. It’s also home to exercise minigames that temporarily boost a given stat in the next battle and a Wyvern riding minigame that earns you additional bond fragments. You can train in the Arena, fish, collect ingredients in the orchard, and explore this hub to find items. The Somniel is expansive enough but, in most ways, a step back to Three Houses’ monastery, which felt like a crucial pitstop in between every combat encounter and a place I came to know like the back of my hand. The Somniel never quite felt like home, but rather a place to strengthen my party for the next battle. Given the game’s focus on combat, though, this wasn’t surprising. Still, I was slightly disappointed it didn’t have more personality. &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/2cbaec3c/fire_emblem_engage9.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/a5a8118b/fire_emblem_engage10.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;The Somniel is also home to the multiplayer-focused Tower of Trials, which is where you can build maps, connect them to other players’ maps, and duke it out in Outrealm Trials. While this is neat in practice, Engage gives you the same square base to build on, and every map felt similar as a result, with the biggest differences coming from where I placed a fire cannon or something like destructible crystals. Every map I played on, including the ones I created, lacked the excitement, variance, and challenge of the developer-made maps in the single-player campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also the Tempest Trial, which has you fighting across multiple battles in one go for increased rewards, and the Relay Trial, which sees multiple players controlling the same units in a relay-style battle. But neither these nor the Outrealm Trials are things I see myself returning to post-game. They’re interesting additions but feel half-baked, only there for those who desperately need more after the core game’s dozens of combat encounters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engage’s characters and social systems never quite hit the high bar set by Three Houses, but it does surpass its predecessor in almost every other way. Players looking for deep customization, expertly crafted strategy RPG combat, and a heartfelt story with adoration for more than 30 years of Fire Emblem history will find that and more in Engage. It’s one of the most gripping games I’ve played on Switch and, ultimately, one I struggled to peel myself away from. If Three Houses was an experiment with where Fire Emblem’s social mechanics can go, then Engage is doing the same for the series’ evolving combat, and excelling just as much, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;"You know how fuzzy memories can be." It's a convenient and hand-wavy line delivered by the new character Lim, warning the Straw Hat Pirates of the impending adventures into some of One Piece's most popular story arcs. Likewise, One Piece Odyssey can be a fuzzy experience. It oscillates between being thrilling and tedious. The promise of discovering "what if…?" scenarios is enticing for longtime fans, but it rarely follows through in a meaningful way. And as a potential introductory point for new fans, One Piece Odyssey falters as most of the context and characters in the core story flashbacks are stripped away. While I'm conflicted about my time with One Piece Odyssey, it's a testament to the series' RPG outing that I'm fond of the overall adventure despite some glaring holes throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Piece Odyssey's wholly original content starts slow but builds intrigue well every time I return to the island of Waford. That's where elastic outlaw Monkey D. Luffy and his notorious crew find themselves stranded. Trouble finds them quickly as a stoic girl named Lim uses her powers to separate Luffy and his friends from their strength and abilities, storing them in mystical cubes scattered around the island. Along with her caretaker, an explorer named Adio, Lim helps restore the Straw Hats' power. To do that, they must enter a world of memories to recover what was lost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/17a21178/op1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/afd90073/op3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/bd05029c/op4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/b9d1571c/op5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/e33bde75/op6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/762c2271/op7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/683c45b4/op8.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/8e0df443/op9.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;These early hours introduce not only turn-based battles but also exploration. Most Straw Hat crew members can be switched between while traversing the world, each with unique and valuable skills that fit naturally with the character. Being a rubber man, Luffy can stretch his arms to grapple to areas in the environment not accessible to other characters or snag sparkling trinkets in the distance. Likewise, Chopper's small frame allows passage into tight spaces only he can fit. Crafting systems, such as cooking healing items with Sanji and forging accessories with Robin, are delightful touches that extend the characters' ship roles meaningfully into the gameplay. Combined with the authentic dialogue between the crew, One Piece Odyssey wonderfully realizes who these characters are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a mix of sketched and realistic textures, One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda's style translates spectacularly into the character models and world. Areas like Alabasta and Water Seven are well-realized, along with the creatures and funky-looking characters inhabiting them. The signature attacks of the crew, like Zoro's sword techniques or Chopper's transformational Devil Fruit powers, are killer in motion. The anime's Japanese VO cast also adds a welcome level of authenticity, making Odyssey feel like another chapter of the anime. While the addition of English VO or the anime's score and theme music would have been appreciated, what's there works well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attention to detail is on full display in Odyssey's turn-based battles, which like Luffy, have an abundance of flexibility. Maybe too much. Combat feels grand, splitting the crew into multiple micro-battles, usually making them fight their enemies before helping elsewhere unless ranged or AOE abilities are on hand. The process of picking off enemies and then consolidating the full force to clean up the surviving foes is satisfying, as is completing bonus objectives that reward additional experience. What helps make fights a little too easy is the option to swap the position of any character at any time with no penalty, as long as they haven't attacked. Exchanging the places of Nami and Brook, who are supposed to be tied down in different zones, feels like cheating. The battle system has a lot of potential but not enough restraint to make it truly special.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6318772615112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the initial adventures into Memoria drag, the second half picks up considerably as the action and the stakes in Memoria and on Waford hit a fever pitch. Much of the content Odyssey revisits is underwhelming, and void of context for the events at hand, save for some lore dumps in the game's menus. Still, critical moments in the final hours had me in awe, thanks to fun hypothetical situations with characters that didn't happen in the canon story. I wish more of those moments were spread throughout One Piece Odyssey to make better use of the wonderful settings and characters on hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have reservations about the experience as a whole – however, I can't help but smile thinking about this adventure with the Straw Hats. It nails the core cast of characters, the Memoria areas are fun to revisit, and the revelations surrounding Waford, Lim, and Adio ultimately satisfy. Of course, I can't thoroughly recommend this voyage for someone new to One Piece, but seasoned pirates will find a worthy adventure on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Golf Story was one of the biggest surprises in the Switch’s extremely strong first year on the market. Thanks to Golf Story’s charming, nostalgic presentation and novel sports/RPG fusion, Sports Story has long been one of my most anticipated sequels. Unfortunately, its unfocused nature and frustrating gameplay are only overshadowed by a pervasive lack of polish that prevents Sports Story from being worth your time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, Sports Story expands the world to include other games while creating a more sweeping and ambitious story. As sports go, golf remains the most prominent; everything in the story is told through the lens of a golf-crazed world, and that often plays to the title’s strengths. Stepping back onto the links, selecting the right club and ball for the job, and teeing off across the eight courses on offer (as well as dozens of minigames) is still as fun as it was in the previous title. The approachable three-click meter usually plays well, and considering the distance, surface, and wind direction&amp;nbsp;to deliver a perfect shot never ceases to satisfy. In these fleeting moments, I’m reminded why Golf Story was such a success. Sadly, despite golf being the best sport in the game’s stable, the less-enjoyable sports and tedious story too often distract from this glaring strength.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/243b4d87/ss2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/62ff2128/ss3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/03f2e0bf/ss4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/febd5af9/ss5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/16/5672f973/ss6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Sports Story adds activities surrounding BMX, tennis, cricket, volleyball, fishing, running, and baseball, but only a few are more than diversions. Tennis takes up perhaps the most time, but it doesn’t live up to golf’s superb blueprint. In addition to requiring far too precise character placement and swing timing, I also encountered moments where the game would simply give the point to my opponent, even when I clearly scored. The other sports are mostly relegated to minigames, with BMX serving up a mix of enjoyable races against the clock and frustratingly tough obstacle courses. Each time a different sporting event appeared, it made me glad when Sidebar Games returned to the world of golf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the story side of the equation is not much better than the sports side. On top of that, it takes up a disproportionate amount of the more than 20 hours I spent in-game. Where Golf Story used this part of its game to lay on the charm and humor, Sports Story’s dialogue is mostly tedious and unfunny. Save for a few enjoyable bits, the jokes fell flat most of the time, and I never felt invested in the narrative arcs. Not only that, but the constant reliance on fetch-quests meant I spent too much time trying to find the abstract solution of who I was supposed to talk to or what I was supposed to interact with. The more focused dungeons have some simple-yet-enjoyable golf-focused puzzles, but they’re only a small percentage of the overall time spent exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6318773012112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unignorable lack of polish accentuates all these problems. I rarely went more than a couple of hours without the game crashing me back to the Switch home screen, and on a couple of occasions, I lost a significant amount of progress. Perhaps more substantially, the game doesn’t run well; the frame rate drops and gameplay stutters are annoying when I’m exploring the overworld, but when they happen in the middle of the timing-based backswing in golf or precise gameplay of tennis, they result in me missing a pivotal shot or losing a point. These ever-present problems combine with less frequent issues like quests not properly completing, dialogue not triggering, and my character clipping through the environment, truly hammering home just how buggy Sports Story is. At one point, my character began levitating over the map when I went to cast my fishing rod, allowing me to bypass blockades and essentially break the mission progression chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if Sports Story was polished and bug-free, it would still fall strikingly short of the first title in the series. The new sports don’t play well, the fetch quests are tiresome, and the story is tedious and less charming than that of Golf Story. What remains of the retro golf experience is fun, but the whole game feels like a textbook example of being unable to deliver on lofty ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Retro platformers are not hard to come by. I count myself among the group of video game players who welcome efforts from small development teams that play to our nostalgia for an era where playing video games meant tuning to channel 3. Some are fantastic, some are too hard to be enjoyable, but most land somewhere in the middle. Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider won’t go down in history as one of the greats that both embraces the past and modernizes the action, but I would place it closer to the fantastic side of the scale, even if it doesn’t quite make it all the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider, you are the titular Moonrider. You break out of your container and destroy the guards in a violent display that would have made you grateful your parents weren't watching had you been playing it on your Genesis in 1992. The story is sparse but enjoyable. For most of the experience, I wondered if I was the bad guy and enjoyed Moonrider’s soliloquies about how unrestricted power isn’t appropriate for anyone, no matter how noble their intentions. I also appreciated the little bits of personality injected into every boss before beginning the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rbewg2ODaJM" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is secondary, however, to the platforming and sword action. Moonrider moves well, bounces off walls like Samus Aran, and sprints to leap over large chasms. He feels great to move, but some annoying shortcomings appear where you can’t see your next platform due to the camera limitations. To zoom out would make it feel too much like a modern game, but I don’t know if it was worth the Genesis-era accuracy to be occasionally annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the jumping and sword action, which accounts for most of the game, there are a handful of motorcycle levels. These levels toe a difficult line of looking like they could have existed on a 16-bit console, but I am almost certain they couldn’t. More importantly, however, I enjoyed them as much as the standard platforming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty is often a shortcoming for comparable games, with many emphasizing challenge over fun. Thankfully, Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider finds a good balance. Levels are hard, but achievable thanks to reasonable lives and checkpoints, and bosses have patterns that can be tracked and exploited, but probably not on your first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Taking inspiration from Mega Man, after clearing the first level, the other six can be pursued in any order, and defeating its boss rewards you with a new weapon. The mechanic is a familiar one but it works, and it’s exciting to try out your new tornado weapon, or my favorite, a tentacle that ejects from a portal. Hidden upgrades, like a double jump or the ability to become stronger the more enemies you defeat, can also be found in every level and can optionally be equipped. I enjoyed these as rewards for exploring off the main path, but some are undeniably more useful than others. I found two early on that I never unequipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best things going for Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider is its length. Making your way to the last level and defeating the final boss only takes a few hours. In this way, it knows exactly what it is: a brief but enjoyable nostalgic experience that doesn’t overstay its welcome. By the time you start feeling like you’ve completed a full retro meal, credits are right around the corner and I appreciate it for that. Moonrider’s adventure likely won’t linger with you, but I don’t regret playing the short, familiar, and satisfying experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Many JRPGs have slow openings, taking their time to establish the story and familiarize the player with the mechanics before letting them loose into the world. I figured that was the case after playing an hour of Dragon Quest Treasures, so I said to myself, “It’ll get good soon!” I said it again two hours in, three hours in, and five hours in, until eventually, I was forced to accept that this was as good as the game would get. Dragon Quest Treasures is never short on charm or style, but simple, sub-par combat and loot-hunting mechanics had me scraping the bottom of the treasure chest in hopes there was something I’d missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players of Dragon Quest XI will recognize protagonists Mia and Erik, though they’re much younger in this game. Dragon Quest Treasures is technically a prequel to XI, but there’s hardly any overlap, and the vast majority takes place after the twins jump through a portal into the mysterious world of Draconia. After getting their bearings and making a few friends, they start a treasure-hunting gang and decide to find all seven Dragonstone, magical relics from Draconia’s origin. While the start of the game is story-heavy, most of my 25 hours of play were self-driven, which I appreciated. The plot isn’t particularly interesting or engaging, but I didn’t need it to be; it’s mainly a vehicle to get the player to explore the islands around them.&lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/05/3909a9e0/dqt_pirate_attack.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;The bulk of Dragon Quest Treasures involves exploring open-world islands to hunt for valuables, which can be found buried in glowing spots on the ground. Mia and Erik track it down by using magic Dragon Daggers to see “treasure visions,” glimpses of the landscape near the burial site seen through the eyes of the monsters in your party. You can use these images to triangulate the position of the buried chest and claim it as your own. It’s not a terrible mechanic, but it isn’t complex or engaging enough to base the whole game around. I also encountered multiple instances of items spawning in the same areas upon revisiting an island, which suggests that there’s a finite amount of treasure locations to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve gathered as many valuables as you can, your goal is to return to base unscathed. Treasure storage capacity is limited, and you drop your current spoils whenever you die. There’s also no fast travel. You can use a button in the menu to return home, but this causes you to drop all your riches, effectively voiding your expedition. You can fast travel without dropping anything if you use a chimera wing, but they’re rare, expendable resources that I kept stashed away for emergencies. These mechanics are all purposefully inconvenient, but they bothered me more in theory than in practice. I rarely died in the field, and I was only forced to use a chimera wing two or three times by the time I finished the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you return to your hideout and appraise your haul, it reveals a beautiful rendering of a character or item from past Dragon Quest titles. Even though I didn’t recognize many of the items I found, I appreciated this detail a lot, and I’m certain that nostalgia for the series would greatly heighten the experience. And as much as I didn’t really care for the treasure vision mechanic, I can’t deny the satisfaction I felt when I returned to base with a full inventory and uncovered an iconic, expensive relic that I got to add to my hoard.&lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/05/db73d02f/dqt_skystone_treasure.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;When you’re not hunting treasure, you’re fighting enemy monsters. Most Dragon Quest games are turn-based, but Dragon Quest Treasures uses seamless, in-world action combat. Unfortunately, the combat is limited and clunky; the attacks at your disposal feel uncomfortable to use, and often caused me to take damage or miss shots. For example, Mia and Erik can attack with their daggers and roll out of the way of enemy offense, but movement in battle is sluggish and cumbersome. Dodge rolls are helpful when you’re watching an enemy strike from afar, but since rolls don’t interrupt dagger attacks, I didn’t have time to evade when I was up close dealing melee damage. As a result, I learned to avoid the dagger in most dangerous situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other weapon you can use is a slingshot loaded with different elemental pellets, but I wasn’t a huge fan of this either. Up close, everyone moves around too quickly to get a shot off, and while the reticle is capable of locking onto enemies, it’s finicky, and I often had to fight against the controls to line up shots. Still, the slingshot is the only way to deal elemental damage as the player, so it’s not wise to ignore it. Once I had the money to buy pellets consistently, most fights had me hanging back and using my slingshot while the rest of my team fought up close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team in question consists of three monsters that fight enemies automatically. Outside of commands to attack or retreat, you don’t have any control over what they do or where they go. This is fine, though: It gives each monster a sense of personality, and while I wasn’t in control, I could predict their behavior pretty reliably. For example, my silver sabrecat Blanco had a powerful move that caused him to rocket toward the enemy, but my red dragonling Bernie liked to stay back and use magic. You can build a team around their combat roles, but I usually chose mine based on their Forte abilities: traversal techniques specific to each monster species. Blanco was a mainstay because he could sprint, something I couldn’t do otherwise. I also liked having a monster that could glide in case I wanted to jump from a high point without taking fall damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you defeat a monster, there’s a chance that you scout it, making it available to recruit. To add them to your team, you just need to pay a fee of items and food you can find in the world. If you don’t have the correct items, you can see the list to narrow down your search, but it’s never any more specific than one of the five massive islands. This limited my party selection by a surprising amount, and I went the whole game without finding enough resources to recruit certain monsters. I’m sure I could have found more resources if I took the time to grind out a few trips with that express purpose, but I wasn’t struggling in battle, so it didn’t feel worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole reason you’re recruiting monsters and hunting for valuables in the first place is to complete Dragon Quest Treasures' main objective: finding the seven Dragonstones. I wrongly assumed they would be hidden behind boss fights or within dungeons, so it took a long time before I grabbed the first one. I thought I needed a higher-level team to compete with the powerful monsters that roamed near the objective marker, but this was totally wrong. In fact, for several early Dragonstones, all you need to do is run past the enemies and then complete a simple objective or just grab the relic and leave. The stones themselves don’t even take up a treasure slot in your inventory, so you can use the menu to return to base and not worry about dropping it; you don’t need to come up with an escape route. Sadly, the game is not clear about this, and I spent a lot of time doing unnecessary grinding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s this buildup of minor annoyances that makes it hard to recommend Dragon Quest Treasures. The experience is driven by charm and nostalgia, but if you don’t have an existing appreciation for the series, there isn’t much here that I could recommend over most other open-world role-playing games. It’s an experience that would greatly vary depending on the player; in other words, one player’s Dragon Quest trash is another player’s Dragon Quest Treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Soccer Story is a charming role-playing adventure that seamlessly builds a joyous and often goofy story around something as simple as kicking a ball. A cataclysmic event causes&amp;nbsp;soccer to be banned unless sanctioned by the evil Soccer Inc. (with more than a few parallels to real-world FIFA), and our young hero’s father goes missing during the catastrophe. A year later, a magical soccer ball comes crashing into our hero’s life. What comes next is an often silly and fun story about bringing soccer back to the world, filled with anthropomorphic panda goalkeepers and an evil soccer corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players first set out to Soccertown to put the magical ball to use. The town is a shell of itself. The stadium is locked up, graffiti goals are sprayed around town in an act of rebellion, and evil Soccer Inc. referees are constantly monitoring for illicit five-a-sides. Existing in this soccer-mad world is delightful, thanks in large part to its absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main story sets Leo or Kai, depending on which twin you choose, on a path of liberating Soccertown, recruiting teammates, and winning soccer matches before setting off to the next area. Once your team is set, and you’ve grabbed Soccer Inc.’s attention by bringing soccer back to Soccertown, you visit new areas for story missions and various side quests. You'll visit a forest, a beach, the bizarre Zen Zone modeled after a mythical, cherry-blossom-heavy Japan, and more as you follow the formula of entering new areas to explore and liberate. It’s fun to sprint around with your soccer ball in each area, and it’s rewarding to finally unlock a gate to a new zone. The zones never overstay their welcome before you’re on to the next one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;The incentive to continually explore and complete NPC&amp;nbsp;missions is huge, but you never feel bogged down, nor do missions feel tedious;&amp;nbsp;they’re fun and quick to complete. Plus, talking to NPCs usually provides comedic one-liners worthy of a chuckle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of exploration and questing, you’re rewarded with coins and medals, which can be used to upgrade your hero’s speed, shooting, energy, and strength. Some missions&amp;nbsp;outright give you medals, and it’s important to seek them out for two reasons: They affect your players in matches and your hero while exploring. Like any good role-playing game, upgrading&amp;nbsp;your player’s stats is rewarding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many missions integrate soccer in a fun way, like taking shots at sharks to protect swimming kids or slide-tackling crabs to save a stranded beachgoer. Shooting a ball onto a crossbar emulates the real-world crossbar challenges players engage in across pitches worldwide. And some quests are downright weird; at one point in Zen Zone, the game turns into a turn-based RPG while fighting giant mushrooms. These moments make Soccer Story&amp;nbsp;much more engaging than doing normal soccer tasks, and it continually dives into its weirdness head-first. However, some quests, like knocking down coconuts, can be annoying when you run in circles looking for that final target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6317302005112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you leave the adventuring and missions, Soccer Story falters. Chaos and inconsistency mire the actual soccer matches. Running around to tackle players is exhausting, and shooting feels random. Increasing your scoring chances requires whittling away at the keepers' shields, making charged shots important but opening you up to defensive maneuvers while stationary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after pouring upgrades into my main character, goalkeepers deflected my best shots without breaking a sweat. Other times, a weak shot from across the field would effortlessly float into the goal. This lack of consistency is confusing and aggravating. Speed seems to be the only upgrade that matters, as most on-field upgrades don’t feel impactful, and it’s frustrating to lose a match after seemingly having an edge.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a sense of some control, but the matches can be so random it’s off-putting. I found a good rhythm of shooting close and hammering home rebounds into the corners of the goal that was more tedious than fun, and I just wanted to be out of a match and back into the proper adventure. That’s not a good sign for a soccer-based RPG. You also compete in numerous one-versus-one matches, but thanks to its basic formula, these felt more like padding than meaningful additions. The actual soccer portion of Soccer Story is just serviceable and frustratingly inconsistent, which is a bummer when compared to the rest of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Soccer Story is a tale about the&amp;nbsp;beautiful game, the soccer matches take a backseat to story and exploration. The adventure and role-playing aspect is a lot of fun, especially with soccer so integrated into the world, but the weak soccer matches keep it from truly being a great sports role-playing game. Buoyed by its charming and humorous premise, Soccer Story provides a satisfying adventure and a different type of soccer game, but one that doesn’t quite score a hat-trick.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Comedy is tough to execute in video games, and even if done well, it still needs strong gameplay to back up the jokes. High on Life falters on both fronts. Though it swings for the fences on presentation and tone, the mediocre action, grating humor and dialogue, and less amusing technical hiccups made me want to keep its sentient guns in their holsters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceived by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland, fans of that show or his other works can expect a similar brand of relentlessly over-the-top, extremely adult comedy. As a human teenager turned intergalactic bounty hunter following an alien invasion of Earth, you must save humanity with an arsenal of talking alien guns. These weapons, voiced by Roiland and comedians including JB Smoove and Tim Robinson, talk your ears off to the point of annoyance, with your primary gun, Kenny, being the biggest culprit. Sometimes their banter doesn’t even make sense, such as a gun complaining about not being used in ages when I’d used them seconds ago. Thankfully, you can reduce weapon chatter via a menu slider, but it represents one of my biggest issues: I didn’t find High on Life funny.&lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/15/55aba0e8/high_on_life_5.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;High on Life screams at you for hours about how hilarious and messed up everything is through tiresome dialogue exchanges that take potentially amusing bits and run them into the ground. The humor isn’t so much about setting up clever punchlines as it is about reiterating the same basic gag with a barrage of expletives until it, hopefully, becomes funny. It usually doesn’t. What’s more, everyone feels like slight variations of the same crass caricature, whether it's your irresponsible older sister or freeloading bounty-hunting mentor. The game pokes fun at everything, including making fourth-wall-breaking wisecracks about game design and the industry in general. However, it also does little to freshen up the tropes it lampoons. Ripping on a pipe puzzle for being by-the-books without doing anything unique itself makes the joke feel hollow and hypocritical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it never had me in stitches, High on Life has a few humorous bits. I smiled at the aggressive banter of a family of loud-mouthed construction workers, and a head-turning reference to a popular restaurant chain offers a fun visual gag. Obtaining special discs that summon small diorama-like areas that serve as large, singular jokes garner some of the better laughs, as do a sprinkling of unexpected celebrity cameos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High on Life’s humor whiffs more than it hits, and the gameplay isn’t far behind. The shooting feels passable enough to offer mindless fun, but it’s not great. Melee executions evoke Doom’s glory kills without the satisfying snappiness. The limited arsenal of living weapons have primary and alternative firing modes. Kenny, for example, fires standard pistol rounds and can unleash mortar-like goop balls that launch groups of targets airborne to juggle with bullets. My favorite weapon is Gus, a shotgun that fires a large disc that ricochets off enemies. In a neat twist, you can strike this disc to extend its momentum. &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/15/05c7e5f2/high_on_life_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/15/bcfd8bc9/high_on_life_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/15/ab60869a/high_on_life_4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/13/515ef13c/oldtown_high_on_life.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/13/d0551be0/gus_high_on_life.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;Combat begins as a drag but picks up as you acquire more guns, and I enjoy combining their talents. Unfortunately, the enemy variety is disappointingly small, so most encounters feel the same. As the adventure progressed, I began avoiding optional firefights when possible since they started feeling more like busy work. Boss fights are just as flat, and some throw way too much at players, leading to several cheap deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of battles, you’ll explore a minimal selection of planets that offer large explorable hubs featuring Metroid-style ability gating and decent platforming challenges that utilize your jetpack. Although they look good from an artistic standpoint, they feel surprisingly lifeless with NPCs that act more as signposts to deliver questionably funny quips. High on Life desperately needs a map or compass, as the zones are large and confusing enough that it’s easy to get lost. I often wandered searching for inconspicuous warp gates to return to HQ. The lack of a map is also egregious because planets have stores that sell exclusive upgrades, but locating these needles in a haystack is a chore. One shop offered a cool upgrade I couldn’t afford, and when I returned later to buy it, finding the store again became a hassle I eventually abandoned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High on Life also suffered from numerous technical shortcomings during my time with it. On top of general hitchiness, I sometimes encountered enemies that froze or snagged on geometry. I had to restart one lengthy firefight when a pair of flying enemies got trapped behind a wall, halting my progression. Prompts can sometimes break, such as when I missed out on rescuing a captive human because the command suddenly disappeared. Grabbing a collectible once launched me into the skybox, forcing another reset. A post-launch patch seemingly ironed some things out, but I still encountered several wrinkles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite multiple shortcomings and my general aversion to the game’s writing, High on Life has occasional glimmers of potential. I’d like to see a sequel polish and improve upon this foundation. I’m always itching for more creative takes on shooters, but High on Life is a reminder that “different” doesn’t always mean “good.” &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Since its inception nearly three decades ago, Need for Speed’s best entries have combined style and substance to produce thrilling homages to the street racing scene. Need for Speed Unbound feels like the ultimate realization of that philosophy, creating one of the franchise’s best in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sliding into the driver seat of the nearly 150 cars in Need for Speed Unbound feels terrific. Blasting down a straightaway in a McLaren delivers a remarkable sense of speed but nailing a corner drift in a Mitsubishi feels just as good. Actions like drifting and drafting fill your boost gauge, creating a satisfying rhythm in the moment-to-moment racing as you flow from one move to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distinct visual effects permeate nearly every moment of Need for Speed Unbound, making it one of the most stylish racing games I’ve played. Though the city and vehicles maintain their photorealistic looks from past games, the characters are cel-shaded cartoons. These two contrasting styles sound like they should clash, but they work in tandem to create a refreshing amalgamation. Unbound further leans into stylization by adding street-art-inspired flourishes to the car as you drift, boost, and jump off ramps. I appreciated the neon-colored smoke during a tight corner, but the tag that pops up when your boost is full sometimes blocked my view during critical points in the race.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/12/5de20cdc/nfs3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/12/d1297bbf/nfs4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/12/50550f56/nfs2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/12/9fcd980a/nfs6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/12/61c1415a/nfs7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/12/3cf6a11b/nfs5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;As you take to the open streets of the fictional city of Lakeshore, you have a bevy of events from which to choose. You can take part in linear races, lap-based circuits, head-to-head contests, and drifting events – not to mention the various collectibles and challenges scattered throughout the city. These each present exciting challenges, but my favorite event is Takeover, which puts you in a tight course and rewards you for drifting, boosting, hitting ramps, and smashing targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need for Speed Unbound’s single-player story centers on a betrayal and subsequent rise up of the city’s underground racing scene. While the overarching story is easy to ignore, the constant chatter between the characters accentuates their grating personalities. Rivals repeat hackneyed lines throughout each race, while open-world exploration is often interrupted by calls from your annoying manager or radio segments featuring ham-fisted politician caricatures. After my first few hours, I turned down the dialogue in the menu. However, I actively enjoyed hearing from Rydell, the owner of the garage and father figure to your created character, as his conversations deliver&amp;nbsp;some truly earnest moments despite this game’s brash style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cop chases have long been a critical element of the Need for Speed formula, and Unbound implements them in effective manner. Each event and chase in which you participate raises your heat level for that day, with higher heat spelling more relentless police officers with better vehicles at their disposal. I often left the base model police cruisers in the dust at heat level one, but as the heat ranks climbed and the cops broke out more capable vehicles, tension crept throughout my body as I gripped my controller tighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6313356183112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making it back to a safehouse with high heat can be daunting; I often rerouted my path to avoid kicking off a lengthy chase. Though I usually escaped, the danger of knowing that any money I earned in that session would be lost if I’m apprehended creates adrenaline-fueled affairs. Though the few times I was caught made me want to walk away in frustration, the exhilaration of a high-stakes escape is difficult to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, cop chases are absent from the game’s online suite. This wouldn’t be such a letdown if I could reliably find full events. However, since the online side just dumps you into a Lakeshore instance with 15 other players who seem more interested in exploring the city than racing, the online races themselves are often sparsely populated. Once you’re in a race, the servers are stable, and the crossplay works well, but I was disappointed my garage progress in story didn’t carry over, leaving me ill-prepared for my early races. Thankfully, the generous reward system let me catch up fast, but I missed the upgraded vehicles to which I grew accustomed from the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need for Speed Unbound feels like a foundational entry for where the series could go from here. Competing across the title’s many events is a blast, and I love the juxtaposed visual aesthetics. Though some elements left me wanting, Unbound is as much fun as I’ve had with a Need for Speed title in years.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Final Fantasy VII is experiencing a strange identity shift. The ongoing remake is changing the original canon in bold ways while spin-offs like the 2006 PlayStation 2 game Dirge of Cerberus are being folded in for larger roles in the main story. And then there are new spin-offs, like First Soldier, the online mobile battle royale shutting down early next year, and also plans for another remake called Ever Crisis, a mobile game that will reexamine Final Fantasy VII’s timeline. With all that swirling around the Lifestream, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion emerges as a surprisingly faithful remake of the 2007 PSP game that smartly focuses its changes on gameplay while keeping the story intact – warts and all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crisis Core takes place before the events of Final Fantasy VII and follows the story of 1st Class Soldier Zack Fair. For those who entered Midgar for the first time with Final Fantasy VII Remake, Zack’s story is a crucial element of the Cloud and Sephiroth relationship, and playing Crisis Core both illuminates and shrouds Zack’s surprising cameo at the end of Remake. As someone whose main interaction with the universe of Final Fantasy VII was with Remake, I am grateful to learn who Zack is and his whole deal ahead of future entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning that story, however, is often a chore. Crisis Core has a fantastic ending that leads into Final Fantasy VII in a thrilling way, but the journey to get to that final cutscene, perhaps unsurprisingly, feels like a game from 2007. The updated voice performances are good, but the presentation is stilted and slow. I found myself wishing I could watch cutscenes at double speed as characters awkwardly shifted into different animations during grueling pauses in dialogue. The cadence of conversations is rough, but the new visuals are great and nearly bring it up to the quality of Remake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That difficult cadence extends to the overall pace as cutscenes often feel interrupted by quick combat scenarios, or a series of combat scenarios feel interrupted by a slow-as-molasses cutscene. Neither appropriately leads into the other, giving the whole game a start-and-stop feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The star of Reunion is those combat scenarios, however, which have smartly received the most attention. Hitting monsters with your sword, executing magic attacks, and calling in special abilities is flashy and smooth. It lacks the impressive versatility and diversity of the excellent combat of Remake, but it looks close enough that you might assume they are similar at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Digital Mind Wave (DMW) is Crisis Core’s main distinguishing feature that randomly rewards you with powerful attacks or temporary upgrades based on a slot machine constantly running in the corner of the screen featuring characters you’ve met during the story. The benefit of the DMW is sometimes you get access to powerful attacks when you need them most. The downside is it is completely random, so there is no way to use it tactically. On the occasions when I was struggling with a boss or powerful enemy, I would just replay the fight until I was randomly rewarded the opportunity to summon the fire demon Ifrit, or a comparable attack, which is not a satisfying way to tackle an encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the ongoing Final Fantasy VII re-examination, which Square Enix has officially dubbed the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, Crisis Core feels like required reading. Its place in the larger story is important and will likely grow in significance moving forward, but making your way through those story moments sometimes feels like a school assignment. Reunion is a well-executed remake of the 2007 game that delivers fun combat alongside a stilted story with an interesting and narratively important final act. If you plan on starting or continuing the Final Fantasy VII Remake journey, make sure to do your homework.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;On June 27, 1972, Atari, as we know it today, was born. Well, technically, it was born a few months earlier under the name Syzygy Engineering, but the &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; Atari started life in 1972. I know this and many more interesting facts about the company because of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, Digital Eclipse's love letter to the gaming giant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atari 50 is essentially a playable documentary, walking you through 50 years of Atari's games, home consoles, handhelds, and PCs split into five different timelines. Each of the five timelines focuses on a different aspect of the business, with dates sometimes running concurrently. Each one is packed with videos, images, design documents, and more. It's a museum exhibit in a box and a delightful one to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This magical history tour contains an astounding 103 playable games, from the original 1972 arcade version of Pong to a selection from the Jaguar and Lynx, Atari's final home console and handheld, respectively. Each is a 1:1 port as if Digital Eclipse ripped the motherboards from the machines themselves and transferred the game into my console. While there are plenty of old favorites like Asteroids, Breakout, and Adventure, I found some of the lesser-known titles, like Quantum and I, Robot, fascinating in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/06/9fb64bf7/atari2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/06/4f94f65e/atari3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/06/a0f18694/atari4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/06/09c45782/atari5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/06/371ce4bf/atari6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/06/1bcffe80/atari7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/06/f2fe4c6b/atari8.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/06/0904b70f/atari1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Not content to simply port over old titles, Digital Eclipse included a handful of other titles elevating this collection to the stratosphere. Two separate homebrew games appear in the story, one for the Atari 800 PC and the other for the Atari 2600, which showcase just how much can still be done with older consoles in the present day. Seeing a game company even acknowledge the homebrew scene is rare, but for Atari and Digital Eclipse to embrace the community enough to include it here is wonderful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it's Digital Eclipse's own creations that steal the 50th-anniversary show. The Reimagined series includes seven old-school Atari games rebuilt by the team for the modern age, and seeing these older games is wonderfully nostalgic. Haunted Houses is my favorite reimagining, as the defined 3D environment completely transforms the original experience. Yars' Revenge Enhanced is also very good, even though it doesn't stray as far from the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must include one important caveat: these are Atari games in their original form, meaning they are as rudimentary as classic games get. Some games have the lifespan of a mayfly, while others – the multiplayer games in particular – have more to offer. Even the Reimagined set, while well-crafted, may only last 15 to 20 minutes per session. This is a collection of quick hits, and it doesn't take very long to get through the 100 games included in the library, meaning your mileage may vary from a replayability standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the game library, the love and care Digital Eclipse put into this project is unmistakable, as is evident by some of the relics it has included in each of the timelines. The hundreds of photos, old box art, and videos offer an incredible look back at what Atari was at the height of its powers. The old 1980s-era TV commercials are particularly notable; seeing a child express excitement for E.T. is hysterical in hindsight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these inclusions go above and beyond. Take The Swordquest series, which had three released games and a fourth that never launched. Back in the day, each game was bundled with a small comic book that not only told the story of the game, but also gave clues on how to solve the puzzles within the corresponding game. Atari 50 includes each one of those comics in their entirety so you can get the full experience and benefit from those clues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for that fourth unreleased Swordquest, Digital Eclipse found the design concepts from the series' creator Tod Frye, built it from scratch, and included it as one of the seven "Reimagined" games. To say that this collection is thorough is an understatement, and Digital Eclipse's respect for the source materials is noticed and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of the historical inclusions are the dozens of video interviews with not only members of the Atari team throughout the years but other prominent game developers across the industry. Notable Atari alumni featured include company founder Nolan Bushnell, Al Alcorn who is credited as the creator of Pong, and programmer Eugene Jarvis. Other featured names include Double Fine's Tim Schafer and Gears of War creator Cliff Bleszinski. Each interview adds new stories, anecdotes, and a bit of technical wisdom to the legend of Atari, while giving the whole collection that special documentary feel, with little moments of explanation peppered throughout a treasure trove of digital artifacts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, Digital Eclipse has set a new bar for future historical compilations in video games. It's a digital traveling museum exhibit, as the game bursts at the seams with nostalgia thanks to more than 100 playable games and hundreds of relics from the developer's vault. While a good amount of the games offered will pass by quickly, those brief life spans cannot weigh down the amazing historical value of Atari 50, and I hope Digital Eclipse has more wings of its digital history tour opening in the coming years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      Firaxis Games
      &lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt;
      Teen
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Play enough games, and you start to develop an eye for the ones that are going to demand&amp;nbsp;a lot of your time and focus. Within minutes, I knew Firaxis’ comic book-powered adventure with the Marvel superheroes would be one of those games, filled as it is with numerous currencies, cosmetics, and gameplay systems. Midnight Suns is a strategy/RPG of tremendous depth, character development in both storytelling and upgrades, and many dozens of hours of gameplay to uncover. While the repetitive nature of the storytelling structure is sometimes a chore, the combat is top-notch. It injects the slow-paced XCOM tactical experience Firaxis is known for with a gamma-powered boost, leading to rewarding battles that stay fresh even after you’ve sunk countless hours into the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ancient evil has awoken, threatening to plunge the world into the darkness of an Elder God’s malice. Familiar heroes like Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, and Captain Marvel have no choice but to resurrect the long-dead Hunter who once defeated the threat hundreds of years earlier. You control this revived hero as they lead Earth’s mightiest against this danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat follows the turn-based tactical loop of Firaxis’ XCOM games but abandons giant battlefields and cover points for tighter arenas and a card-based action selection inspired by deck-building gameplay. Each character has an array of card attacks, skills, and heroic abilities that leverage their unique talents, and it’s tremendously fun to stack each character deck to greater heights of dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there’s plenty of time to consider each move carefully, the action feels more bombastic and faster moving than most tactical games. Every card has a special animation accentuating the character’s uniqueness, and the battles look beautiful as they play out. Wolverine surges back from a KO with renewed power. Magik’s portals send enemies hurtling across the field. Captain America flings his shield to bounce between hapless Hydra forces, taunting them to take him on. And everyone leaps over barriers, hurling boulders and blasting explosive barrels to add to the chaos – just like any good cinematic superhero fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6316433633112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:11px"&gt;The complexity of this system grows over time, gradually layering in objectives you might need to confront or unique enemy mechanics you must overcome. You might be asked to damage a helicopter before it takes off or confront a demon who summons forth obelisks every turn that must be smashed if you don’t want to be overwhelmed. Get deep enough into the game, and you even start to see some fascinating puzzle challenges crop up, where you must complete a particular task using only certain cards or other constraints. Firaxis built a robust and exciting combat engine and leveraged many ways to keep it engaging and new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:11px"&gt;In between battles, you return to the Abbey, a sprawling social and exploration space. Here, you can upgrade and train your heroes, build new combat items, and unlock an impressive array of cosmetic tweaks for characters and home décor. The grounds of the Abbey also house a mystically infused adventure game of secret clues, arcane treasure chests, and story snippets about the past; it leads to some intriguing discoveries but can sometimes distract from the flow of the main story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:11px"&gt;The Abbey also acts as a giant friendship simulation, where you gradually play out interpersonal dramas with the likes of Spider-Man and Blade. The dialogue selections (and the option to choose light or dark conversation responses) is most reminiscent of BioWare games like Dragon Age or Knights of the Old Republic and can sometimes come across as overly simplistic. A metric ton of these interactions unfold over the course of the game; each builds your status with these individuals, which in turn reflects in their abilities during combat. I mostly enjoyed the focus on character development. But with a game this big, I eventually tired of the rote loop of conversations after every mission, some of which devolve into dull dialogue exchanges that would be more at home in a reality TV show than a superhero adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:11px"&gt;For all its focus on supernatural magic and demonic threats, Midnight Suns is a fun-loving and thrilling ride. XCOM strategy fans won’t be disappointed; the format changes still result in a gratifying combat flow. But this is a more approachable and story-driven experience than Firaxis has previously attempted, filled with some of the most recognizable pop culture heroes of the moment. It’s big, boisterous, and a little bit silly at times, but just like the best of Marvel’s output in recent years, it’s also a rousing good time.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Nearly a decade and a half ago, Visceral Games released Dead Space, a now cult-classic survival-horror game inspired by the likes of &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Thing&lt;/em&gt;. If you've ever yearned for a return to its mix of sci-fi and horror, or if you want a near-identical experience to Schofield’s first survival horror hit, you’re in luck. Schofield's latest, The Callisto Protocol, veers incredibly close to Dead Space, for both better and worse. Unfortunately, though, it’s far too familiar. There are glimmers of greatness, namely in its opening hours, but what unfolds after is a tiresome and unsurprising eight hours that feel like a relic of the past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Callisto Protocol is set primarily in Black Iron Prison and the surrounding area on one of Jupiter’s moons, Callisto. After a crash landing, correctional officers imprison protagonist Jacob Lee and Dani Nakamura in Black Iron Prison. Something goes wrong; Jacob escapes his cell, and shortly after, meets his first biophage, a highly-mutated monstrosity who’s more fleshy pustulating gore than human. &lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/01/c4fd73ed/img_1404.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;The game introduces its unique melee combat system here, and it’s one of the highlights. Dodging by pulling left and right on the control stick is engaging, as are the heavy and slow swings of Jacob’s melee attack. Each hit carries a ton of impact, and with proper timing and precise dodges, I took down enemies using just this electrified prison baton in a satisfying way. Guns are later folded into the mix, but they’re not as satisfying as the baton, nor do they meaningfully differentiate themselves from one another. Upgrading my baton to keep it useful until the end felt like a necessity, although ammo is plentiful if you wish to go into encounters with guns blazing. The telekinesis-like pull-and-throw GRP system is useful and fun, but there’s disappointingly little to do with it beyond throwing enemies into the same three types of insta-death machinery, off a ledge, or away from you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are asked by characters talking through the radio to go &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, and right when you show up, something goes wrong, and now you need to meet them at &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; location instead. After a few hours, I was predicting most of the story beats in advance, all the while being fed bread crumbs of a larger narrative. Sure, things happened, but I rarely saw a semblance of the game’s overarching story until the final hour, at which point it felt like a rushed dump of information. While Dani’s story, which weaves in and out of Jacob’s throughout the duration of the game, comes to a satisfying conclusion, Jacob’s does not, ending with a scene that feels inorganically enticing and designed to ensure I purchase the upcoming story DLC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final boss before this disappointing climax is an exhausting and repetitive fight that feels like those of yesteryear; the one every game had to include, even if it didn’t prove necessary. This wasn’t the only disappointing boss. All of them left me feeling empty and annoyed at the lack of variance. You fight the same enemy type as a boss multiple times throughout the game, just in different arenas. Most bosses can kill you in one hit, which takes away the earned stress of survival horror. I wasn’t desperate to find ammo or a health pack to survive by the skin of my teeth; I was just jogging away to ensure its hits didn’t land close to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthering my frustration is a bad checkpoint system. You must redo the entire battle if you die by insta-kill, even at the tail end of a boss fight. If you have to kill a few enemies before that battle, you need to do that again, too. The same goes for ammo, audio logs, and other resources, as well, even if you save right where you’d like to pick up post-death after doing this kind of preparation. Bad checkpointing is also present in standard enemy encounters, which quickly became stale.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/01/3749baa1/img_1403.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/01/e2e83803/img_1402.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/01/6b8510b4/img_1401.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/01/7299ab8a/img_1397.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/01/8201440d/img_1396.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/01/b4fcc081/img_1399.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/01/28fef043/img_1398.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/01/b07abe62/img_1400.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/12/01/6a9a62b1/img_1405.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;Listening to audio logs, which add small touches of needed flavor to the area you’re playing through, requires you to stay in the log menu, and you can’t move or search the environment while listening. The death animations are exciting and gruesome, but they lack variety. They’re buggy, too, and some death scenes are drastically more interesting to watch play out than others. A biophage pulling Jacob’s eyes out of the sockets, for example, is great. But watching an enemy knock Jacob to the ground in an unintentionally hilarious and anticlimactic ragdoll-like fashion falls flat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gun animations, which play when switching weapons, look nice at first, but you must agonizingly sit through each to use a new weapon. If you aim too early or hit reload during the animation, the sequence ends, and the weapon you were using prior to attempting this change returns. This is frustrating during tense combat encounters where I’m flipping through my handful of weapons to find the right one. A unique quick-fire mechanic that auto-locks onto an enemy’s weak point at the end of a melee combo is a nice addition to the combat’s systems, but if your equipped weapon is out of ammo or requires reloading and you don’t realize it, you hit fire only for nothing to happen, leaving you open for damage. The Callisto Protocol dies by a thousand cuts such as these. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These various problems aside, though, The Callisto Protocol is still doing a lot of what Dead Space did, for better and worse. And to that end, there are moments of fun, even if, in contrast, they’re light on genuine terror. I’m okay with The Callisto Protocol being another version of its spiritual predecessor, but it struggles to nail even the basics. As a result, I’m underwhelmed, annoyed, and disappointed. If you wanted anything more out of this second crack at making a new sci-fi IP in survival horror, or something markedly different that acknowledges just how far gaming has come since 2008, The Callisto Protocol is not your answer.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Harvestella wants to be a jack of two trades, but winds up a master of none. Part action-RPG, part farming/life simulation, this combination can sometimes be enjoyable, but the two styles clash more often than not. The result is a sluggish grind more likely to repel fans of each genre than bring them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an amnesiac warrior, you awaken on the outskirts of a quaint village, unaware of your origin and purpose. Four powerful, monolithic crystals called Seaslight govern the environmental stability of the picturesque continent, namely its seasons. However, a deadly fifth season called Quietus occurs between each of the four normal seasons, wiping out crops and endangering humans. This strange normalcy becomes unstable when the Seaslight begin behaving irregularly, seemingly triggered by the mysterious arrival of Aria, a young scientist from the distant future. Like you, Aria is clueless about how she got here, so you partner up to discover your respective origins while also combating a global crisis. Oh, and building a nice farm too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To its credit, the plot is engaging in its absurdity. In typical JRPG fashion, the mystery gradually becomes more grandiose and unhinged as it unfolds. While much of it is silly, I found little of it boring. One revelation made me laugh out loud at how bizarre it is, and I can’t help but respect Harvestella’s willingness to take some wild turns while sprinkling a few poignant moments. A large band of likable party members, such as a smooth-talking inventor, an A.I.-powered robot, and a talking unicorn, joins the primary duo, but you largely spend time with them one-on-one. As such, you don’t often see everyone hang out together, and when they do, the lack of group chemistry is noticeable and disappointing. It’s like inviting a bunch of good friends to hang out who know you, but not each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6308645020112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvestella promotes two styles of play but feels like an action-RPG first and a farming game second. Gameplay involves running through bland dungeons and hacking apart foes, collecting crafting materials and ingredients along the way. A robust job system offers a good variety of playstyles, but I only gravitated toward a few of them. My favorites include the nimble, combo-centric Shadow Walker and the dancing floating blades of the Pilgrim class. Other jobs, like the Mechanic and singing-focused Woglinde, simply aren’t fun to use, and the game rarely encouraged me to experiment once I settled on my favorites. Even with classes and attacks I enjoyed, the combat is middling, and bosses are either pushovers or infuriatingly cheap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farming fans won’t find much unique about Harvestella. You plant crops on tilled land that can be expanded in size several times, process food using machines, but you only rear two animal species. The farm changes with the seasons, which shift every 30 days, and certain food can only grow during specific times of the year. Quietus, which only lasts a day, eradicates crops, but I found it easy to plan around, making it less threatening than likely intended. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like combat, farming only feels passable, but is crucial to success. Selling crops serves as one of the few ways to earn money. You also need a full pantry to whip up a variety of dishes. Eating keeps your belly full, which in turn fuels your stamina bar. This meter governs actions such as farming, sprinting, and even executing special attacks. Eating also replenishes health, often in large amounts depending on the dish. However, you can’t eat if you’re full, which becomes a maddening hindrance during tough battles. Since traditional health potions don’t exist, you’ll be making all of your recovery items. Doing so takes time which feeds into Harvestella’s biggest nuisance: the clock.&lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/30/3f10df05/harvestella_farm.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;Harvestella operates on an in-game day/night cycle that advances in 10-minute increments faster than you expect. Night begins at 6 p.m., and your character becomes sleepy at 10, slowing their stamina recovery. Thus, returning home to crash in your bed – and only your bed as, annoyingly, you can’t sleep at the game’s several inns – is vital. Staying out past midnight causes your hero to collapse from exhaustion, warping them back home. Falling to exhaustion or death comes at the oppressively steep price of paying an increasingly exorbitant doctor’s fee while clicking through the same unskippable cutscene. It’s a loathsome penalty that’s too strict for its own good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you have to drop everything to return home each night, progress becomes a massively slow grind. Dungeon crawling consists of inching forward before you have to stop and resume the next day. Simply reaching a location on the world map burns precious minutes until faster means of travel open up. Even after finding shortcuts and fast-travel checkpoints, you still rerun sections of a dungeon repeatedly until you reach uncharted territory. Doing so inevitably drains your food supply, so you have to set aside time to cook beforehand. Making dishes eats a substantial chunk of the day, limiting the time to adventure. Running out of cooking ingredients means growing more of them, as only a handful of staples can be purchased. That means spending at least a few days waiting for crops to replenish, then creating enough food to venture back into a dungeon, and repeating the cycle all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framework effectively makes it impossible to progress the story for very long. There’s often so much work that has to be done beforehand that I was often lucky to have enough daylight to pursue the missions I wanted. This frustrated me most when the plot hit an interesting turn, and I wanted to see what came next. It’s an awful form of gating, as progress is bottlenecked no matter how powerful or well-equipped I was. In some cases, it can take days of work and prep to complete a single dungeon floor. &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/30/219625d1/harvestella_njord.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/30/5b2cd523/harvestella_heine.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/30/73f782a7/harvestella_argene.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/30/128c72f6/harvestella_cave.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/30/997d2137/harvestella_dungeon.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/30/c3f4e1e2/harvestella_inn.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/30/da384419/harvestella_menu.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;When I didn’t have enough time in the day to complete a story mission, Harvestella admirably provides plenty to do outside of the main narrative and farming. A ton of multi-chapter sidequests await, though most of them involve reading lengthy conversations, completing a basic combat encounter, or running tedious errands. Despite a few interesting stories, these missions aren’t great, but the game makes completing them worthwhile, for better or worse. Side missions offer tons of cash, vital recipes, blueprints, and seeds. To my chagrin, completing as many as possible became a necessary evil. I preferred the party bonding missions, in which I learned about my teammates’ troubles by helping them through unique storylines. These quests were at least more interesting and rewarded me with enhanced physical perks, such as greater strength, defense, etc., practically making them required playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it runs well, Harvestella also suffers from graphical glitches that make it feel unstable at times. Specifically, a strange bug where half of the screen occasionally flickered a solid color, whether docked or in handheld mode. The game also doesn’t look great on the big screen due to its low-resolution textures and models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvestella’s systems feed together in a way that forces you to engage with nearly everything it offers, whether you want to or not. But those slice-of-life activities are mundane and get in the way of letting you enjoy the RPG elements on your own terms. Maximizing a day’s schedule is sometimes rewarding, but the sluggish pacing makes it tough to stay engaged for the long haul. Harvestella forces you to do a whole lot to complete comparatively little. At 70-80 hours, it’s one of the biggest chores I’ve played in some time. That’s unfortunate because the combat, story, and characters are decent enough that, in a more traditional RPG framework, they’d shine brighter. As it stands, squeezing this fruit isn’t always worth its small amount of juice.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Ever since it hit Early Access on Steam last December, the cult of Vampire Survivors has grown and spread its gospel far and wide. Over the past year, the seemingly simple game has expanded with a steady stream of free updates adding astonishing amounts of depth and content. The fantastic gameplay and compelling progression system combined with a ridiculously low price point made Vampire Survivors extremely recommendable. That tradition continues in the full game release making over 50 hours of pure gaming bliss accessible to a larger audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vampire Survivors starts out simple enough. You only use the left analog stick to move around, and your attacks automatically happen at regular intervals. Monsters approach non-stop from all directions as you dodge through the gaps and make sure they’re in your attack radius. The Castlevania influence is clear as you start with a whip and take on creepy creatures from classic gaming horror in addition to imaginative original creations. If you can last 30 minutes, Death will swoop in for an instant kill, but you can consider that "beating"&amp;nbsp;the level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every attempt starts you at a base level with only your character’s starting weapon. While they may seem insufficient at first, almost all offensive options can be built to feel amazing. Blast a firehose of knives in front of you to clear a path. Melt a colony of bats as you wade through them with garlic’s circular field. Take shelter in a cloud of fighting cats. Every weapon type I could imagine and several things I would never have dreamed of were all at my fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/22/bcf660c4/vs3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/22/89b6416b/vs4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/22/2bc27005/vs1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/22/80a85c29/vs2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/22/44e9f95b/vs5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;You’re constantly making decisions, weighing the pros and cons of every randomized item presented during the leveling process. At maximum, you can have six weapons all firing at once in addition to six accessories that modify weapons and gameplay, like increasing the size of projectiles, reducing cooldown time, or increasing the rate of experience gained. On top of that, certain weapon and accessory combos provide ultra-powerful evolutions that can turn the tide at your darkest hour. It’s difficult to convey the supreme satisfaction you feel when your incomprehensible barrage of attacks makes it impossible for enemies to hurt you, no matter how hard you try to kick the hornets’ nest. I rarely take screenshots or videos of games I’m playing, but Vampire Survivors puts on such a glorious show based on your smart choices that I couldn’t help but share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developer Poncle has expertly balanced the rollout of unlocks so you’re never overwhelmed by the mix of weapons and powers, but you never tire of them either. There’s always a new character, weapon, accessory, or mechanic to look forward to all the way to the very end. The initially daunting list of objectives provides a sense of direction and gets you to experiment outside of your comfort zone. In one run, I’d blow it or get a bad shake on level-up options and die without checking off any objectives, but the next, I’d have a perfect run and accomplish a dozen tasks. The unlocks/achievements rain down in a gratifying flurry of dopamine hits. Even when you fail, you learn something and gain more gold to unlock permanent upgrades at the in-game shop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6316031359112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every rule you come to know (including many mechanics described above) gets completely upended or twisted as you progress deeper into the game. Vampire Survivors loves setting your expectations and completely subverting them. At several points, I exclaimed, "What the hell is happening? Wait, so I can do &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; now?"&amp;nbsp;Everything is built to make it impossible to resist that next run. "Well, I have to see how this crazy-looking new character plays."&amp;nbsp;"What’s this unsettling new stage?"&amp;nbsp;"This other strategy has to work. This can’t wait until tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only hesitation in recommending it to Xbox players is the unwelcome presence of launch bugs that impede stage and achievement unlocks for some and other strange odds and ends. Patching has helped so far, and I hope it gets to be as relatively issue-free as the PC versions soon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these early console setbacks, Vampire Survivors has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time. Consider this me grabbing the sides of your head and shouting, "Play Vampire Survivors, you fool!"&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Each new generation of Pokémon promises changes and iterations to the long-standing franchise formula. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet kick off the ninth generation of Pokémon games, offering some of the biggest changes to date. An open world, four-player co-op, and other additions effectively push the series forward in meaningful ways, but the technical shortcomings often break immersion and temper an otherwise strong Pokémon game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon formula remains mostly intact through Scarlet and Violet. Your main goals still involve catching, training, and battling the Pokémon that inhabit the world. But this time, you do so in the series’ first true open world, expanding the formula in unprecedented ways. The Paldea region is ripe for exploration, with diverse biomes and various nooks and crannies in which to hunt. Thanks to a wide swath of Pokémon, new and old species alike, I always felt rewarded for journeying off the beaten path. When I did discover an all-new monster, I often appreciated the design, making this batch one of my favorite new generations in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this open-world approach, most battles are now optional. Trainers occupy the world, but you must initiate the battle with them to start. I like this approach, as it let me skip fights I wouldn’t otherwise want to be in, though the money, experience, and rewards often make them worthwhile. The same could be said of wild Pokémon encounters, which only happen if you run into them; random encounters are completely gone this time around. You can also use the new Let’s Go mechanic, where you send your lead Pokémon out to auto-battle, if you’re just looking for quick experience and crafting materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6315614256112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the larger world comes at a cost, as Pokémon Scarlet and Violet suffer from poor performance across the board. Characters pop in and out of existence before your eyes, textures appear in extremely low resolution, and the frame rate stutters around every turn. Game Freak shot for the stars with its first open world, but it’s clear it still has a ways to go when it comes to making it work on Switch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re in battle, longtime Pokémon players will feel right at home, as it reverts to the traditional turn-based format where type strengths and weaknesses create compelling rock-paper-scissors-style matchups. The new Terastallization mechanic, where an in-battle Pokémon takes on a gem-like appearance and boosts moves of its specific Tera Type, accentuates the type match-up system; some Pokémon even change type when they’re Terastallized. While the moves of the Pokémon’s Tera Type are boosted, they’re hardly overpowered, and since Terastallizing is limited to once per Pokémon Center visit, it adds an extra layer of strategy. The Terastallized forms look uniformly goofy, but Terastallization is my favorite generational battle gimmick in series history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players can explore this new, open Paldea region together thanks to four-player cooperative play. Once players join the host’s instance, they can freely explore, catch new Pokémon, battle in Tera Raids, and even trade with each other. I’m sad there aren’t more interactions between players in these sessions (you can’t even watch battles unfold), but the freedom offered by co-op outweighs the shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open-world design also enables you to choose the order in which you approach the three main questlines. Victory Road offers the series’ traditional eight-gym conquest with the goal of taking down the Elite Four, while Starfall Street lets you attack bases held by Team Star, the rival group of this entry. Gym challenges preceding each leader battle diversify the lead up, but they’re either mundane or revert to the traditional trainer-gauntlet style. Team Star base assaults are easy affairs, where you need to use the Let’s Go mechanic to defeat 30 Pokémon in 10 minutes before an often-challenging boss battle. Path of Legends, a third questline, grants engaging battles against huge Titan Pokémon, provides the best rewards, and serves up a touching story. I enjoyed each individual questline, and while they’re disparate in nature, they converge in the meaningful end and post-game content.&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the persistent mission of filling out your Pokédex exists alongside those three story quests. This mission becomes more satisfying than ever, thanks to a terrific redesign that depicts your Pokédex as a shelf of encyclopedias. I loved watching the shelf fill with each new encounter, but I’m disappointed Pokémon Legends: Arceus’ goals, which required you to study Pokémon before their entry was complete, have vanished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite technical shortcomings and some filler content, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are chock-full of meaningful additions to one of gaming’s most popular franchises. At worst, these games are steps towards the Pokémon games for which players have clamored, but more often, they serve as effective thesis statements for where the series goes from here. Either way, I can’t wait to see where Game Freak evolves the experience from this point.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt;
      Mature
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The best stories in video games manage to fuse narrative, art, and gameplay in a way that elevates all three. Pentiment, the latest from Obsidian Entertainment, is a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pentiment tells the story of traveling artist Andreas Maler and his time spent in Tassing, a fictional town in the countryside of the Holy Roman Empire, way back in the year 1518. While Andreas’ regular routine has him working on his masterpiece or making copies of one of the local abbey’s manuscripts, he quickly becomes wrapped up in a series of local mysteries he tasks himself with solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andreas can be customized with different backgrounds and personality traits to unlock different dialogue options. My Andreas was a theological scholar with a history of hedonism, but another might have studied law and spent his time enjoying nature. The dialogue options these different backgrounds unlock aren’t usually anything substantial, but it’s nice to have a sense of control over your conversations since they make up the vast majority of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/15/d25199a7/pentiment_background_.png" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  


&lt;/a&gt;










&lt;p&gt;Pentiment tells its story across three acts, two of which involve investigating murders. Between the high stakes and the huge accusations, these murder mysteries are when the game is at its best. There’s only so much time to solve the case, but significant actions like eating meals with suspects or searching abandoned ruins will push you through the day, meaning you only have a limited number of chances to chase down the truth. I was desperate to learn as much as possible, but there are more leads than time to follow them. While many murder mysteries end with a satisfying conclusion, Pentiment forces you to pick a culprit with the information you have and live with the consequences of accusing them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not immediately clear whether or not you made the correct decision, but it is immediately clear how the town feels about it. Accuse a brother of the abbey, and the church resents you upon your return; accuse a beloved member of the townsfolk, and the people of Tassing might not admire you as they once did. These consequences are part of what made Pentiment’s story so impactful for me. Each act is years after the last, and the effects of your choices in the previous chapter always feel significant. The town of Tassing changes a great deal too; babies are born and grow into adults, the elderly get older and pass away, and the townsfolk adapt and change. The town is arguably more of a protagonist than Andreas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the strongest part of Pentiment is its adherence to its core themes. It’s a game about passing stories down from generation to generation and how the truth can become distorted over time, for better or for worse. There are rumors that Tassing harbors ghosts, conspiracy, and a dark history, but the only sources of this information are stories from the locals, and each person has a different opinion on what’s true and what isn’t. Andreas’ search for the truth is presented as a story being copied into a book, which is fitting. Like the player, he’s trying to chronicle the complete truth once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book-like aesthetic is one of Pentiment’s most charming qualities. It starts from the first moments of a new save file, where you scrub the pages of an older book to write this new one. Characters and their surroundings are depicted as beautiful, era-specific illustrations. The menu is also a book, complete with a glossary to keep the player filled in on all the historical terms they might not be familiar with. You can press a button whenever one of these terms appears to see their definitions scrawled in the margins of the book the game takes place in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6315617059112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dialogue maintains a storybook aesthetic as well. You won’t hear voice acting; instead, the font changes depending on a character’s social or occupational status. Andreas speaks with a neat yet elaborate font, where each letter is traced, filled in, and outlined. Common townsfolk speak in plain cursive, the printer and his family speak in blocks of printed text, and the brothers of the abbey speak with ornate lettering that looks like it belongs on the inscription of a Roman statue. And as a reminder that the player is witnessing the book’s creation live, dialogue is sometimes written with a typo or two that the invisible author of the book quickly erases. The fonts are a wonderfully effective way of instilling personality into the characters of Tassing, but if you have a hard time reading cursive, they can be disabled in the settings in favor of “easy-read” fonts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the presentation of Pentiment’s story is beautiful, its pacing leaves a little to be desired. I adored the sections with murder mysteries, but the sections without them felt slow. The story preceding the first murder takes a while to get going, and I wouldn’t be surprised if a less-patient player bounces off the game because of it. Still, it’s far more noticeable in the third act, when the stakes noticeably dwindle before ramping back up in the final hour or so. Without going into spoilers, the third act brings significant shifts in the gameplay and story, both good and bad. At that point, it started to feel like I was watching the events in Tassing rather than playing them; I still enjoyed the story, but I didn’t get to make big decisions like in the first two acts, and there was no impending trial to push the characters along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these slow sections, I also started to process my issues with the game’s audio design. Most of the time, Pentiment doesn’t have music playing in the background, which feels awkward when most of the gameplay is just talking to people. The sound of the quill scratching is nice, but I would have liked to hear more of the game’s score, even if it was something sparse and atmospheric. Background characters also don’t stop their idle animations when you talk to a different person nearby, and the audio for these animations continues as well. Mostly silent conversations would be one thing, but talking to a character for two to three minutes while the only sound is the repetitive, incessant sweeping of a nearby broom had me taking my headphones off more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some issues with the audio and the slowness of the third act, Pentiment is a wonderfully unique storytelling experience overflowing with respect for the historical era it strives to recreate. Much like the game’s themes of stories persisting over time, I’ll be thinking about Andreas Maler and the town of Tassing for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Somerville begins with a peek into the life of a young family and their dog. Everyone fell asleep watching TV on the couch, but the curious toddler gets themselves into some inconsequential trouble, forcing the family into their routine. Both the child and dog need to be fed and the kitchen needs to be cleaned, but something feels off. In an explosive moment that truly caught me by surprise, the family is suddenly reckoning with an alien invasion. An intense, often scary adventure kicks off from there. When Somerville hits its highs and fires on all cylinders, it’s a moving spectacle, but unfortunately, technical hiccups and some unclear puzzles hold it back from being truly incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To call a video game an alien invasion story might recall Space Invaders, but Somerville represents something much more intimate and human. The story mainly follows the father of this young family and examines, without any text or dialogue, what the world might look like and how you would survive if everything you knew about Earth instantly changed. You make your way through Somerville by moving along a linear path, solving environmental puzzles, and avoiding instant death at the hands of imposing enemies. By the end, I didn’t know much about the invading force, but I didn’t care because I was only interested in how to stay alive and connected to my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6315570449112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an inciting incident sets the game in motion, the father must leave his home to find safety and take advantage of a strange newfound ability to help solve puzzles and progress. The game’s visuals and audio design are fantastic and mysterious. Bizarre sound effects paint strange explosions in the distance and the occasional light, synth orchestration and unassuming piano pieces are expertly used to punctuate scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplistic designs of the characters and environment are striking. The world feels big despite being tangibly small, and there are plenty of moments where the camera looks out toward the horizon to frame a particularly impressive vista. The animation also feels natural and fluid… when it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somerville’s biggest issue is ultimately a functional one that is sometimes easy to look past, but unfortunately, more often, impossible to ignore. Moments of emotional sincerity are undercut when a character blinks out of existence for a moment, or worse, the protagonist gets stuck in geometry while trying to solve a puzzle. I had to restart checkpoints often just to make sure things executed as they should. The bugs were particularly frustrating in the moments where I would think, “I bet that would have looked great… had it animated correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/14/0e2b71a8/som3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/14/d428a993/som4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/14/638840c2/som1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/14/747a291e/som2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Those issues also extend to puzzle solving. Grabbing levers and switches is inconsistent and jumping up on ledges – a frequent action – is sometimes harder than it should be. Even without those issues, though, there are some puzzles whose solutions I just didn’t enjoy. An early one, for example, involved carrying an object to a specific spot that I accidentally avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Somerville is working properly, however, and the story is being delivered as it should, it leads to some of the most memorable moments in the genre. The invaders are truly scary. I teared up during at least one emotional moment, and the adventure goes places I never would have predicted and ends in a way that would make Steven Spielberg proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first playthrough with Somerville was rough, but I immediately restarted the game after seeing the credits. There is no incentive to replay. No new game plus, or even added context from a second playthrough – I just wanted to experience the story again and hoped giving it a second shot would make for a more consistent experience. It did work better when I knew exactly what I was doing, but I was disappointed my first playthrough felt like a dress rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somerville is held back by technical shortcomings, but is full of impressive moments worth experiencing with the lights turned low and your headphones up high. The father’s adventure lingers in my mind as I reflect on what happened, and those memories do ultimately outweigh the technical shortcomings. I hope time will provide improvements to bring the game to where it deserves to be, which is high in the sky alongside the ships of the invading forces.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;br /&gt;
              &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Puzzle-solving takes up much of our everyday lives, whether we realize it or not. Cleaning a messy junk drawer to make everything fit neatly or categorizing a bookshelf presents subtle mental exercises that flex our logical thinking and creativity. A Little to the Left shines a light on these ordinary tasks with dozens of challenges that promote organization and the satisfaction that comes with it, making for a uniquely pleasing experience.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Little to the Left’s puzzles present tasks as simple as arranging pencils by height or stacking spoons by size. These bite-sized exercises don’t always make me sweat, but I enjoy the tactile sensation of, say, clicking and dragging bits of crumbs away from a dining table to create a clean surface for setting plates. If you find pleasure in even the simplest forms of tidying, you’ll likely sink into this game right away, and this intangible x-factor makes the experience satisfying.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6315174297112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some puzzles have multiple answers. For example, you can arrange books by height or thickness, and I liked finding two or three alternative solutions to a straightforward problem I wouldn’t normally consider. Eventually, things get a bit more complicated. What’s the best way to arrange spice shakers with different amounts and color patterns? What time should I wind a clock’s hands to have the shadows align a certain way? These harder conundrums give the game a nice bite, and I find most solutions clever; at best, I walk away feeling part Marie Kondo, part Einstein. But some problems feel too open-ended in their answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When, for example, arranging piles of disparate shells or leaves to form a hidden pattern, I’ll stare at the screen for long periods wondering what the heck I was supposed to do. Every puzzle has some logic, and tinkering eventually leads to a breakthrough, but sometimes I still didn’t grasp the problem even after solving it. That’s probably more of a “me” issue; I vibe best with less abstract puzzles, like finding the optimal way to hang tools on a nail board. However, others require objects placed a bit too precisely. While tilting picture frames on a wall, I fiddled with one for way too long before, to my annoyance, it randomly settled on a pixel-perfect angle I’d covered numerous times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game’s inventive hint system, where you manually erase an obscuring doodle to reveal a puzzle's correct configuration, is cute and can be helpful, but it has flaws. For one, I usually only wanted to expose a specific piece of the puzzle, so erasing the section I needed required careful precision to avoid showing too much. Since hints are in black and white, color-based answers don’t translate as well. Ultimately, simply looking at the solution isn’t the same as understanding it, making me wish the game presented hints with more direct guidance. Thankfully, A Little to the Left doesn’t require you to finish a puzzle to move on (at least for most of it). Selecting “Let It Be” lets you skip segments without consequence if they prove too tough or simply aren’t as fun. The game wants you to think, but not at the expense of its relaxing atmosphere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/08/f4ebf947/alttl_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/08/af7475a0/alttl_6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/08/4633c45c/alttl_7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/08/3dc76cd3/alttl_3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/08/3685e1ad/alttl_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/08/d1315786/alttl_4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;A Little to the Left provides a good mental jumpstart to my day, so I appreciate the Daily Tidy. These once-a-day challenges offer a decent dose of brain food once you’ve devoured the 70-plus primary puzzles or a good warm-up for them. So far, most of the ones I’ve seen are variations of riddles I’ve encountered, so I hope more unique challenges pop up in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pleasant and, at times, playful soundtrack, fun visual effects, and the occasional light interference of a mischievous cat add to an overall charming package. A Little to the Left may have left me scratching my head in confusion at times, but more often, it left me pleased and content with the neatly arranged spaces I created. &lt;/p&gt;

      Sonic Team
      &lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt;
      Everyone 10+
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In Sonic Frontiers, Sega finds the intersection of the series’ linear past and its “open-zone” future, paying capable service to both eras of the franchise. The open Starfall Islands offer engaging exploration, while linear Cyber Space stages deliver the familiar speed-based Sonic experience. Though each side of the coin has faults, Frontiers is an overall positive experience that serves as a boost in the right direction for the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running through the open zones is often a joyful experience. Sonic controls remarkably well as he runs through the lush fields, sandy straights, and other biomes I encountered during my 30-hour playthrough. The islands deliver terrific playgrounds through which Sonic grinds, boosts, and bounces; hitting a dash panel that sends you up a rail, off a spring, and into a line of rings never ceases to satisfy. That satisfaction is accentuated by how good it feels to chain these segments together, thanks to the tight 3D gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable new ability in Sonic’s arsenal is Cyloop, a blue trail you activate with a push of a button. Cyloop has utility in combat – drawing a circle around enemies deals damage, stuns them, or breaks off armor – but its primary use is in exploration; if ever I didn’t know what to do, the answer was typically to draw a Cyloop around the object in question. You can even run in circles to spawn infinite rings, a method I often used in boss battles. I like this mechanic overall, but reasons to use it in the world sometimes felt shoehorned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6314893312112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, several areas of the open zones aren’t optimized for exploration. The in-world obstacle courses are among the worst offenders. I lost track of the number of times I tried to go in one direction, only to hit a dash panel that sent me flying hundreds of feet in the opposite direction before I knew what had happened. This dilemma is further brought into focus by atrocious pop-in, which primarily affects the rails and platforming elements in the open areas, making it difficult to understand the best way to navigate. Other segments force you into a 2D perspective and lock you into a set path until you either complete the sequence or backtrack out of that area. When combined with various dead-ends and areas that feel overtly tucked away, the world design of Sonic Frontiers doesn’t reach the standard of modern open-world games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the open-zone design sometimes lacks cohesiveness, the islands do a terrific job of doling out the core gameplay loop. Exploration rewards you with memory tokens to progress the side-character stories, but outside of lore drops and revealing the map, scouring every corner of an island is rarely as fruitful as I would have liked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re not sprinting between destinations, Sonic Frontiers gives players the most comprehensive combat mechanics in the series’ history. What starts as button mashing for melee combos evolves as you face new enemies who can counter and block your attacks. As you level the skill tree, you unlock more fast-paced combos to unleash devastating damage on your foes. While the combat is far from the highlight, I enjoyed engaging with enemies when they popped up, and the collectibles and skill points made the encounters worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest reward, however, comes from defeating enemies and mini-boss Guardians in the open area. These Guardians offer novel battles against a wide range of monsters, offering unique encounters that require you to use different tactics to win. Ranging from creatures that lead you on a chase through the world to a tank that forms a closed arena and shifts the encounter to a bullet-hell experience, I was always excited to see what bosses the next island housed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defeating Guardians grants Cyber Space Gears, which let you access the linear, more traditional 3D Sonic levels. These stages concentrate the action into bite-sized chunks, often lasting fewer than a couple of minutes. Each stage features four objectives that grant a Chaos Emerald Vault Key, the main collectible for progressing the main story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved playing the levels over and over to accomplish all these goals; efficiently speedrunning these branching stages is satisfying beyond belief. However, the S-Rank times are poorly balanced, meaning sometimes I would achieve the time on my first attempt, while others are unrealistic unless you nail a perfect run.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/04/c4404848/gc7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/04/4bc66ba1/gc1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/04/7ba31aab/launch2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/04/54ec1d61/gc2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/04/b44cc59e/gc3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/04/364a33b7/gc4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/04/ba5957ef/launch3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/04/3692330f/gc5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/04/9d3c8594/launch1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/04/218ebee6/launch5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;The culmination of each island is a massive boss battle against that area’s Titan. Each Titan battle is drastically different, but they all have you facing an impossibly large foe as Super Sonic. Since Sonic’s golden form is invincible but slowly depletes rings, the battles are more about beating the clock than worrying about damage. This dynamic often leads to frustration as their attacks and projectile spam are meant to delay you as you watch your ring count drop. But with music that feels ripped straight out of an anime credits sequence and multi-phase battles that get more climactic with each transition, the epic, over-the-top nature of these battles won me over and provided some of the most memorable moments in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juxtaposed against the grand scale of these bombastic boss battles, Sonic’s adventure is a largely solitary experience. Save for occasional interactions with his friends and a mischievous A.I. character, our hero goes it alone. This, combined with the minimalistic music score, sets a contemplative tone that I rather enjoyed despite its seeming opposition to the series’ theme of speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tone fits the more somber narrative. The eponymous blue hedgehog is still the same fun-loving speedster. But with a storyline centered around a mysterious species that seemingly befell tragedy long ago, this story is the most mature Sonic has ever been in games, and it largely works. The story features some of the best character moments and contextual callbacks in series history; from Sonic 3 to Sonic Forces, diehard fans will love the passing references the characters make to their previous adventures. I won’t spoil the conversation, but one chat Sonic has with a friend about personal growth is as heartfelt as the franchise has ever been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it’s rough around the edges, Sonic Frontiers is the best 3D Sonic game in years. This first attempt at the open-zone concept is an admirable effort, and I can’t wait to see how Sonic Team iterates on this formula in future entries, but it’s obvious this is not the formula’s final form. For now, Sonic Frontiers stands as a solid first foray into a brave new world for Sega’s speedy mascot.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel. Ragnarök may lack the unique impact of the prior game, but everything that worked so well the first time comes forward, along with a story that earns the proper definition of the term epic.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Ragnarök basically picks up exactly where the previous left off in terms of narrative. Atreus is a little older and has shed the ‘boy’ nickname entirely. In a tradition established early in the God of War series, the opening hours are stellar. The action kicks off immediately, setting up new foes and old friends, but among all the explosive set pieces are quiet moments of engrossing performance showcase. Newcomer Odin and returning scorned mother Freya’s characterizations are particularly fantastic, but even the weakest performance in Ragnarök makes the typical video game performance pale in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excellent moment-to-moment writing outdoes the already fantastic dialogue of the 2018 game. Ragnarök is, surprisingly, the funniest God of War to date. Kratos is the most stoic, straight man in all the nine realms and he surrounds himself with vulgar dwarves, a wisecracking decapitated head, a sometimes over-confident teenager, and more. I laughed often as Kratos said things like, “I do not need a snack,” when Sindri offered him food, or when he shared a dismissive grunt when characters made fun of him for only ever offering dismissive grunts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As key as the story has become to this new era of God of War, the combat remains an equally important element. The most negative thing to be said about fighting the various enemies of the nine realms is it isn’t radically different or changed from the previous game. You start with more weapons this time around, but the core combos are mostly the same. The library of special attacks you can pull off is larger, but I admit I found my favorites early on and was not particularly compelled to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The types of enemies you fight, on the other hand, has greatly expanded. Mini bosses are numerous, and when they repeat, a new wrinkle is typically added, or it is a fully optional pursuit. The optional content, which accounts for far more than additional boss fights, makes up a large percentage of an already massive game. Alongside side quests to pursue next to the main path, there are also large open areas to be explored at your leisure with sled dogs that offer worthwhile moments of character development and tangible rewards. In some cases, I completed side stories with big, important moments and only learned they had been optional afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ragnarök, despite its fantastic setting, does feature a grounded tone thanks to its splendid performances and fully realized characters, but it is not afraid to be a fun video game. Puzzles expertly mix up the pace between combat encounters, and I was constantly impressed with how there always seemed to be story context for engaging in the video game parts. When ignoring the main task to find treasure chests, for example, Atreus would always take time to explain to the new characters that his dad likes loot. Despite the urgency of the story, Mimir would often make sure to state that we can take our time and explore if we want to. These little moments and bits of dialogue showcase Sony Santa Monica fully understands how its players want to interact with its game, and I was always thankful for that understanding.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Considering the player at every moment extends to the exceptional level design, as well. Whether visiting new versions of old locations or entirely new realms, each area wraps around itself to reveal shortcuts, or bypasses the need to backtrack. The well-designed combat arenas feature multiple levels to fight on and environmental attack options, like grabbing a giant rock to fling at that particularly pesky lizard. Even the way the player camera moves to hint at optional chests or tease new paths is impressive and consistent. The players’ direction is always considered.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
God of War Ragnarök feels a lot like God of War (2018), which is a compliment considering how fantastic that game is. Sony Santa Monica was right to not break what wasn’t broken and it has expertly continued the story threads that were left hanging from the previous game. Any complaints about the overall experience (familiar combat, collecting and leveling up equipment isn’t particularly interesting) are quickly forgotten in the face of the compelling narrative, believable character relationships, and incredible visuals and animation. Even from its early PlayStation 2 days, the God of War series has always set a high, quality bar for itself, and with few exceptions, it manages to leap above that bar. God of War Ragnarök is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Without spoiling the ending of Village, the story left off in a way that created some big, interesting questions about the future of Resident Evil. From its beginning, the series has never claimed a singular protagonist, but moving forward, it seemed Ethan’s daughter Rose was going to be an important character to the franchise and whatever narrative direction a potential Resident Evil IX might follow. The Shadows of Rose DLC offers the first chance to play as Rose while filling in a small story gap that arguably did not need filling. Even with a somewhat benign story, however, Shadows of Rose has a solid, condensed Resident Evil experience worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of how are ultimately unimportant, but in Shadows of Rose, the titular Rose is afforded the opportunity to revisit the village her father rampaged through to save her. She’s not there in person, but rather exploring memories of the location using her abilities. To call Resident Evil grounded would be inaccurate, but because Rose is exploring memories as opposed to a real location, there are opportunities to create a more dreamlike and ultimately stranger experience than games past. Rose instantly jumps between locations based on the story and an already uncertain setting becomes even more unpredictable in a way that makes it scarier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also control Rose from the third-person. The perspective is a typical one for Resident Evil, but to explore locations from Village from behind Rose’s back feels surprisingly new. I prefer my Resident Evils in third-person (though I do enjoy the novelty of 7 and Village’s first-person perspective) and seeing the world from behind Rose’s shoulders is well-implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/03/f2b4da55/re_village_ge_shadows_of_rose_01.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/03/71a9485b/re_village_ge_shadows_of_rose_03.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/03/d62221f3/re_village_ge_shadows_of_rose_04.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/03/394ae90c/re_village_ge_shadows_of_rose_6.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/03/07b432b1/re_village_ge_shadows_of_rose_7.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/03/a186267e/re_village_ge_shadows_of_rose_8.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/03/1bee5baa/re_village_ge_shadows_of_rose_9.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Lady Dimitrescu unfortunately does not make an appearance in the game, but exploring her castle again (with many paths blocked and doors locked) is a scary thrill, especially with Rose’s abilities. Rose uses a handgun and a shotgun, but isn’t an especially proficient fighter. She eventually uses her abilities to slow down enemies, which works well with Resident Evil shooting as it lets you line up headshots with less urgency. The main use of her powers, however, is that she can destroy the flowers with spreading tendrils that have infected the castle from a distance. Between shooting mold creatures with limited ammo, I enjoyed solving the puzzles of how to reach these flowers to open new paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rose also visits House Beneviento, which was home to Village’s (and maybe all of Resident Evil’s) most genuinely terrifying moments. Considering the recent legacy of House Beneviento, it’s no surprise that this is the scariest and most interesting part of the DLC. Rose must solve puzzles without her inventory (as her father did before her) and encounters mannequins that only move when you’re not looking at them. The mannequins wouldn’t make sense in a typical Resident Evil, but in this dreamlike, memory world, they function as some of the series’ most terrifying enemies. I was grateful to move past these horrifying yet impressive enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To dive deeper would reveal important story beats, none of which stand out as being a major highlight, but I enjoyed learning more about Rose, revisiting locations from Village with a new perspective (both literally and figuratively), and getting more context on her role in the universe. Considering her potential importance in the future, I assume Shadows of Rose will be an experience worth having played, but I wouldn’t go quite as far as calling it required reading. For something more abstract and focused on horror within the world of Resident Evil, Shadows of Rose is worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I don’t envy the developers of puzzle games. They have to create puzzles formidable enough to be challenging and exciting, but not so much that the player feels more burdened than empowered. The best walk that line almost perfectly, and The Entropy Centre is chock full of them. But The Entropy Centre is more than its brain teasers, and it’s that “more” where the game hits its stumbling blocks. Despite that, its core design is unlike anything I’ve ever played, and genre enthusiasts will find that this game bends their brains in new ways worth experiencing. I only wish the game’s pacing and polish lived up to the thrills its 60-plus puzzles gave me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since The Entropy Centre’s reveal earlier this year, developer Stubby Games has been quite clear in its inspirations. This sci-fi game unfolds in an abandoned brutalist facility where you solve puzzles color coded primarily with orange and blue. Oh, and there’s an A.I. with a bubbly personality and a dry, deadpan sense of humor. Naturally, my mind immediately compares it to Valve’s Portal series, and on the gameplay front, The Entropy Centre succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6307424466112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aria awakens in an abandoned moon facility called The Entropy Centre, left alone to discover that the Earth will experience a cataclysmic event any minute. It happens and because of the Earth’s destruction, said space facility is now at risk of blowing up, and Aria must stop it. To do this, she must solve puzzles with her A.I.-powered gun, Astra, to charge the station with entropy so that its time-reversing device can stop Earth’s apocalyptic calamity from ever happening in the first place. This premise immediately grabbed my attention, and I loved reading emails on the centre’s various computers to learn more about other apocalyptic events entropy had prevented.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story ties that premise, Aria and Astra’s place in it, and these in-world emails together nicely, warning that without forward thinking, no outside force can help the Earth survive; if we, the human race, don’t get our act together, our world will die. I just wished the game’s pacing didn’t dampen any climactic feeling I might have felt otherwise. Multiple times I thought I was reaching the game’s big “a-ha” moment, only for it to throw me through another gauntlet of challenges. And while I loved trying to solve each puzzle as an isolated instance, I didn’t love how often they felt like tiresome roadblocks during the game’s third act. The entire experience feels bloated as a result, and I felt exhausted more than anything else when the credits rolled. Still, though, that bloated third act is offset by two-thirds before it that are intriguing and engaging in a way the best games in this genre are.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;The game’s dozens of puzzles all revolve around special cubes. You place these cubes on pads to power up elevators or open gates. Some cubes don’t do anything on their own. Others act as jump pads to help you reach high-up platforms or as bridges to help you cross gaps. The Entropy Centre continues to dole out new types of cubes throughout the 15-hour experience, and I met each with enthusiasm to see how it might rearrange my mind’s puzzle-solving toolbox. The cubes alone won’t reveal your solution, though – you need Astra. This gun can turn back time on an individual object by 38.1 seconds and as a result, every obstacle becomes one where you must first envision how a sequence of events must play out and then reverse it in your head so that you know exactly how to set it up. To put it simply, solving a puzzle in The Entropy Centre requires that you determine where you need to end up and work backwards to find the beginning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6311006021112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end, I was solving puzzles using multiple cubes, all of which did different things, and feeling like a genius as I watched various time-reversing paths place everything exactly where I needed them. It hurt my brain at first – a lot – but I quickly learned the rules by which The Entropy Centre worked, and I was delighted to find an entirely new type of puzzle as a result.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, I’d lose five minutes of progress because a cube would disappear into a wall, causing me to restart the entire sequence. Nothing was more frustrating than watching a cube glitch into the wall before disappearing entirely. The game also crashed entirely on me a few times. Ultimately, though, the satisfaction that solving each puzzle gave me outweighed the frustrations I experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With The Entropy Centre behind me, I’m fascinated by what Stubby Games accomplished with its debut. It’s full of excellent puzzles, but the stuff around them, like bugs and narrative pacing, stop the entire package from coming together in an equally impressive way. Despite the exhaustion I felt as the credits rolled, I’m stoked The Entropy Centre exists. It brings something unique and new to the genre, and I hope Stubby Games continues to iterate on that in a sequel, spin-off, or spiritual successor. It’s not every day a game shows me something I’ve never seen before that it also happens to nail, and what The Entropy Centre does well is worth pushing through its long narrative to ensure you see every trick up its sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Call of Duty: &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii" target="_blank"&gt;Modern Warfare II&lt;/a&gt; is a very unpleasant game. Like every Call of Duty game, the majority of time spent playing involves either killing or being killed in horrendous ways, for one thing, and there’s a natural revulsion that comes from seeing so many gouts of blood shooting from bodies or the ragged slump of newly lifeless human corpses piled up in a doorway. And yet, the surface-level hideousness of its parade of death might not be so notably ugly if it wasn't for Modern Warfare II's cast of characters and the way they – drawn from international special forces, a private military company’s contractors, and a Mexican cartel – view the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Warfare II opens with a lightly fictionalized version of the real-life assassination of Iranian Quds Force commander Major General Qasem Soleimani. As in the actual Soleimani’s killing, Call of Duty’s fictional Quds Force commander “Major Ghorbrani” is assassinated by American forces using a drone strike, here controlled by the player. In a departure from recent history, this affront to a sovereign nation is met with a byzantine terrorist retaliation plot concocted by the dead general’s successor, Major Hassan Zyani. Sketched in brief, this plot is a modern paranoiac’s dreams come to life, Zyani collaborating with Russian allies and a fictional Mexican cartel to plan a missile strike on the continental United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Call of Duty has pulled from recent history to frame its stories in the past, basing Modern Warfare II's set-up on such a contentious event – and naming Iran specifically rather than choosing to abstract the reference by setting the assassination in one of the series' fictional nations – provides a promise for narrative ambition that the game fails to fulfill. Instead of delving into the political murkiness that the Modern Warfare subseries is well positioned to examine, what follows is a disappointingly cynical and aimless exercise in storytelling.   &lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/06/08/0eb75c2f/mw2heli.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;Players assume the viewpoints of characters attempting to thwart Zyani, embarking on a whirlwind globe tour that throws away the larger implications of the story's conflict in favor of more immediate, less complicated matters.These characters include British members of the invented Task Force 141 and Alejandro Vargas, a colonel in the Mexican Special Forces, as well as occasional segments seen through the eyes (and lens of a gunship camera) of Modern Warfare II’s American-based private military organization, Shadow Company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot unfolds in predictably bloody fashion. Players turn distant enemies into puffs of red while sniping during stealthy infiltration missions, run and gun and blow stuff up in all-out firefights, and control or call in air support to blast distant targets into dark smears. They do so motivated by the urgency of survival. What the Iranian, Russian, Mexican, or the American government (outside of one CIA Station Chief and a general) think of their countries covertly and openly tearing each other apart is ignored to concentrate instead on the granular next steps in advancing or stopping Zyani's plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Warfare II is determined not to bore the player by constantly tweaking Call of Duty’s fast-paced, first-person gunfights as it tells this story from mission to mission. At its best, the flexibility of its format allows the game to switch genres to heighten its dramatic purposes. In one mission, for example, Task Force 141 operative John "Soap" MacTavish is stranded in a small Mexican city’s cobblestoned streets. As he tries to hide from the American PMCs mercilessly executing civilians throughout a stretch of moonlit alleys and roads, Soap finds himself cast in a veritable horror movie. The player must collect household materials to craft tools and weapons to pick off members of a superior force as they set about their massacre. The dark of the night and the presence of so much brutality construct strong, appropriately shocking imagery of the PMCs' evil. Soap, stalking through the shadows of gore-stained houses, shops, and alleyways, becomes another creature from a nightmare thanks to the level's design. If this mission was another of Call of Duty's all-out firefights, it would have little room to establish that same sense of dread. Here, a willingness to play loose with form heightens storytelling possibilities.    &lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/01/d5941685/mw2-seasonal.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;In other cases, though, numerous sequences that should be thrilling on premise alone – hanging upside down from a speeding helicopter while shooting enemies; fighting from hijacked truck to hijacked truck up to the front of a convoy, Fast &amp;amp; Furious-style; swimming through an Amsterdam port and dispatching patrols before sinking back into the dark waters once more – become tiring exercises in trial and error. The fragility of the enemy and player alike interrupt the action by making the margin for error so slim that what should be exciting sequences end up coming across more like someone repeatedly sitting on a remote control’s pause button during an intense scene by mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the few levels that validate Modern Warfare II’s emphasis on variety, the traditionally designed firefights make the campaign exciting. One involves the player participating in raids on a series of rural homes, navigating the inky darkness of an overcast night through the queasy green of night-vision goggles. It even ends with you defending a crashed helicopter from inside its ruined interior while enemies advance to attack from across a smoking, firelit field. Even if the game featured a few more missions with staging this compelling, the plot would still color Modern Warfare II in offputting tones. Simply put: None of its cast seems to care about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During cutscene interludes breaking up the action, the characters find little time to discuss their mission beyond identifying the next part of the globe to fly off to or the next enemy who needs their brain pulped. They are all blandly gruff, almost seeming to compete in a gravel gargling contest as they discuss the grim necessities of extrajudicial murder or trade strained banter during tense moments. These are the kind of characters who, when handed a hunting knife with which to kill a cartel boss, grumble the single word “sweet” in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No motivation is expressed by the characters beyond the most cynical realpolitik or greed. If any members of Task Force 141 have nuanced opinions about the countries whose militaries they’re fighting or the cartel forces abetting an international terror plot, they keep it to themselves. Even Zyani speaks of his hatred of America in only the most general terms. There is no greater political or religious mission for anyone, likely in fear of alienating any demographic that may play the game. There are only reactions to circumstances – a kind of kneejerk fantasy of global politics that sidesteps historical context in favor of painting an Iranian major as an uncomplicatedly evil villain.&lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/06/09/f8b2189b/cod2.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;One exception to this nihilistic pattern is Colonel Vargas, who is forced to shoulder the massive weight of Modern Warfare II’s stunningly grim depiction of Mexico. As one of the few heroic viewpoint characters, Vargas is asked to embody the noble and incorruptible crime-fighter that, in Call of Duty’s viewpoint, is the only possible means of solving a nation’s complex internal and hegemonically enforced problems. Though Vargas is a welcome character in this sense – him narrowly avoiding death from the overeager trigger fingers of police and armed citizens of a Texan border town who can’t distinguish between him and cartel sicarios is striking – he’s also an overly simplistic one. Vargas, like the game’s depiction of Mexico as a whole, is drawn from a position of sanctimonious pity – one that sees the country populated not by criminals, as in the simple, racist viewpoint, but by perpetually doomed unfortunates whose misery can’t be understood beyond its inevitability.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vargas, however, is just one character among many, and the question remains, as is the case with every Call of Duty entry, of what purpose the dead-end ugliness of the rest of the game serves. That Modern Warfare II’s characters exist is not an endorsement of their actions. That the story they star in exists to frame their attitudes toward the world, though, means all of the virtual shooting and death must mean something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Modern Warfare II has no ready answers to these questions. The campaign’s story is agile in side-stepping concrete ideological positions, slippery in establishing any political footing beyond a basic recognition that attacking civilian populations is morally wrong. The game's writers seem to believe in very little beyond the current status quo of international politics, anxious to avoid much specificity and, by doing so, resigned to a stalemate existence of looming terror and secret wars fought by covert operatives forevermore. As an extension of this, Modern Warfare II asserts that our desire to play pretend in its fevered war dreams is testament to there being a magnetic thrill to witnessing the kind of combat in which regular military and special operatives engage around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multiplayer, as always, functions as the best proof of this assertion. Compulsively thrilling in its best modes – Domination, Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, and Kill Confirmed – Modern Warfare II’s gunplay finds better expression in the hamster wheel of endless online competition than it does in its single-player mode this time around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few major changes have been introduced to multiplayer overall, but the tweaks that have been made to player movement, the speed at which competitors can kill (or be killed), and loadout customization options work to make Modern Warfare II's online some of the series' best in recent years. The result is less a drastic overhaul to the style of online shooting that Call of Duty's featured for years and more a welcome series of refinements that amplify what works and minimize what doesn't.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New modes, like Prisoner Rescue, playlists featuring a disorienting third-person camera, and a trio of co-op missions, are less exciting, but their inclusion doesn’t take away from the substantial volume of returning modes that take place in the new maps and provide a framework for exceptional shooting. Freed from the single-player’s trappings, appreciating the game’s feel is easier. The elastic response of pressing a controller trigger so an assault rifle’s sights spring up into view, the dull thud of rounds hitting home, and the spry weight of the player character: Modern Warfare II’s multiplayer is a tightly designed display of its makers’ talents.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/11/01/d5941685/mw2-seasonal.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/15/6751b69b/mw1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/15/f1ba6fa3/mw2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/15/4d8b6886/mw3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/06/09/53b0efc3/cod1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/06/08/ef799de4/mw2map.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;But still, the game’s dismal narrative creeps in to curdle even its best features. Maps like a Mexico-U.S. border crossing traffic jam, bombed-out Ottoman forts in a fictitious Middle Eastern village, and a Mexican city turned battlefield are all excellent blueprints for online shoot-outs. But they also serve as a reminder that the multiplayer is a reflection of the campaign’s plot. Severed from its storyline, the disjointed visions of nations in flames and ruins, overrun by soldiers, are hardly less nasty than the rest of the narrative.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Severing these connections and focusing instead of the immediate pleasures of competition is tough but not impossible. With a few friends talking over the crack of gunfire and an eye trained on the burst of experience points that pop from a newly dead opponent, Modern Warfare II is perfectly enjoyable. But this kind of wilful blindness is hard to maintain, and the impression left is overwhelmed by the unpleasantness that defines so much of the game. Ignoring that for long makes it much harder to appreciate what Modern Warfare II does right than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether any of this is enough to put off an audience inured to Call of Duty’s detached depiction of brutal warfare is anyone’s guess. Plenty of people can put up with a bit of ugliness if there’s still a pretty good time to be had overall. For Modern Warfare II, the good time offered by its multiplayer and in glimpses within its campaign may be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;By the end of &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/bayonetta3" target="_blank"&gt;Bayonetta 3's&lt;/a&gt; third chapter, it's operating on a scale that dwarfs most video games. Buildings twist and crumble like flimsy plastic, giant craters pock-mark the earth, and mountain-sized creatures level entire cities; the bombastic culmination of an opening three hours that feel like they're running a mile a minute; a never-ending barrage of stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's loud, obnoxious, and frankly a bit exhausting. And I was hootin' and hollerin' the entire time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bayonetta series has always been &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/10/bayonetta-is-the-best-playing-game-ever-made" target="_blank"&gt;at its best when you're staring slack-jawed at your TV&lt;/a&gt;, repeatedly muttering, "What the hell is happening?" The series is excessive by nature in terms of violence, action, and sexuality. Rapid and repeated combos lead right into flashy, bloody, and extravagant animations, all bookended by goofy cutscenes where the titular witch flaunts her sex appeal, using it to distract, taunt, and encourage those around her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayonetta 3 is, of course, no different. From its opening seconds, you're thrown into large-scale fights necessitating you juggle numerous enemies at once while switching weapons, summoning giant monsters, and dodging attacks. And to that end, when you're playing as Bayonetta, it's the best the series has ever felt. For more than 12 hours, I never tired of her combat, happily welcoming every new wave of enemies or difficult boss. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is largely due to how Bayonetta 3 changes the series' formula. The game no longer relegates Infernal Demons (basically large monsters Bayonetta summons to fight alongside her) to cutscenes at the end of a boss fight; they're an entire mechanic. So long as you've filled your magic gauge, you can summon one of these beasts, called Demon Slave here, almost whenever you want and control them while you fight. Somewhat against their intended use, I mainly used mine as finishing moves. Capping off a combo with a massive attack from one of my four equipped monsters always felt powerful and weighty and went a long way in leveling the odds against the game's many, many bosses. For the entirety of Bayonetta 3, it's constantly throwing Infernal Demons your way, and I loved testing out each new addition. That said, outside of gameplay-specific sections, I mainly went back to the first two the game gives you, Gomorrah and Madama Butterfly, but that's more an issue of my complacency than a lack of viable variety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the defining characteristic of Bayonetta 3 is an absurd amount of options and variety. Equal to the massive amount of Demon Slaves is Bayonetta's weapons, each with its own gimmick, strength, and disadvantage. I mainly stuck to the lightning-fast, far-reaching Ignis Araneae Yo-Yo as my primary weapon, with the massive Dead End Express hammer-saw hybrid for slower but heavier attacks. Quickly striking with the former, dodging to trigger Bayonetta's signature Witch Time (which slows everything but you), then slamming enemies with my massive hammer before summoning an Infernal Demon as a finisher was constantly entertaining. If anything, I wish there were more encounters. I often dropped most normal enemies after only a couple of big combo strings, leaving me to rush to find the next idiot to beat up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayonetta 3's 14 chapters constantly fluctuate between settings, sending you quite literally around the world and then some. From Japan to New York to Egypt, to beyond the reaches of space and time, every level has a unique visual palette and core conceit. I loved figuring out where in the world I was going next, but more than that, I loved the ending of each chapter, which featured a bombastic, larger-than-life setpiece that more often than not completely flattened the level you just explored. These include massive kaiju battles (a personal favorite), a fight high above the Earth's stratosphere where a God-sized being blows bubbles at their opponent, and a literal battle of operatic proportions, among others. Some sequences are better than others, but they're all a spectacle, so for the few that don't feel quite as good, at least they're fun to look at. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all moves along at an incredible speed. Bayonetta's pace is nearly non-stop, constantly throwing new enemies, bosses, and setpieces at you and asking you to deal with them. It's overwhelming, and I loved it. Bayonetta 3 never wants you to be bored and does everything in its power to keep your eyes glued to your TV or Switch screen, no matter how exhausting that might be.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/24/7a0ad1b0/bayonetta3_nintendoswitch_scrn_09.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/24/1964bfc0/switch_bayonetta3_screen_66.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/24/fe89ed87/switch_bayonetta3_screen_67.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/24/6d6f966d/switch_bayonetta3_screen_57.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/24/821c81e0/bayonetta3_nintendoswitch_scrn_01.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/24/a0296271/switch_bayonetta3_screen_58.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/24/caa29078/bayonetta3_nintendoswitch_scrn_02.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/24/56794a3b/bayonetta3_nintendoswitch_scrn_03.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, Bayonetta 3's story is the most comprehensible in the series. Which is to say it's not largely gibberish. Bayonetta is charming throughout, as is most of the cast of returning characters, such as Jeanne, Luka, and Rodin, but the larger narrative is a rote multiverse story. Some big bad man is trying to seize control of the various dimensions to control space and time. This introduces multiple different Bayonettas (a fun narrative way to give you those aforementioned different weapons), and there's a late-game twist that neatly alters the Bayonetta lore. For the most part, though, the narrative is largely forgettable beyond surface entertainment value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story does, however, introduce the weakest parts of Bayonetta 3: all the levels in which you don't play as Bayonetta. Early on, the new character Viola is introduced, a young punk from a different dimension who needs Jeanne and Bayonetta to help her save the multiverse. This sends Jeanne on a mission to find a scientist to help the trio. Jeanne's levels play out as a stealth-focused side scroller, though it's never all that engaging beyond running from point A to B and occasionally fighting a boring boss. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The handful of Viola's levels are mechanically interesting but don't nail the landing. Viola is a hack 'n' slash-focused character, and her Witch Time is tied to a parry rather than dodge. That parry window is incredibly tight and my opening hours with the new witch were frustrating until I finally got the hang of it, at which point it became only slightly more fun. She does have her own Demon Slave, a giant cat named Cheshire (a nod to previous games), that came in handy when I just wanted to brute force my way through levels. &lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/24/6583a53b/bayonetta3_nintendoswitch_scrn_10.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of introducing new playable characters to the Bayonetta series, but Viola did nothing for me. Cosmetically, she's an office worker's approximation of a punk rocker, more Spencer's Gifts than 924 Gilman Street. But even then, she's bland and uninteresting. The game forces you to spend numerous hours playing as her, and I struggle to think of a single defining characteristic other than her corny mall punk aesthetic. Viola being bland and forgettable is unfortunate because despite the series' often lackluster storytelling, it has always featured incredibly fun characters. Considering the implication that Viola may play a much larger part in potential upcoming games, I'm disappointed she doesn't match the charm of Bayonetta. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that's a small complaint at the bottom of a mountain of compliments. Bayonetta 3, for the vast majority of its runtime, is an absolute blast. It's bombastic, over-the-top, and extravagant for the sake of extravagance, leaving ruins, literally, in its wake. I'm already going back through each level trying for better scores, and I have no immediate plans of stopping. I may be hesitant about the series' future, but at present, this is the best Bayonetta has ever been. &lt;/p&gt;

      Everyone 10+
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Pairing asymmetrical multiplayer experts IllFonic with the Ghostbusters license is a match made in the spirit realm. Previous outings Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunting Grounds pit Jason and Predator against camp counselors and mercenaries with flashes of greatness, but technical issues and uneven design choices held them back. With Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, the team has applied everything it’s learned about compelling asymmetrical multiplayer to a property that perfectly lines up with the game style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four fully-customizable Ghostbusters face off against one ghost on five maps ranging from an Alcatraz-inspired prison to a cozy lodge. The key difference from other asymmetrical games is both sides are fun to play. You’re not just biding time until you can play as the ghost. If that’s all you want to do, however, it’s easy to set your preference and be haunting random players online with hardly any wait time (at least during my tests on launch day). The active early player base and full crossplay between all platforms combine to make this happen, and it’s impressive to see such smooth execution out of the gate. If you’re a Ghostbusters fan who doesn’t like online multiplayer, it’s easy to play against not-so-challenging bots and still experience all the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The match flow starts with Busters fanning out with P.K.E. meters drawn to track down the ghost and its respawn points. These rifts are hidden within objects, and destroying them takes away one of the ghost’s three “lives.” If you encounter the ghost directly, you can zap it with your Proton Pack and wrangle it into a trap to eat up a life as well. On the ghost side, you try to haunt as many objects as possible and scare the NPC civilians wandering around to increase the overall haunting level of the map. Once haunting reaches 100 percent or the ghost runs out of rifts, a final endgame timer begins. If the Busters capture the ghost in that time, they win. The map is officially haunted if the ghost evades capture, and the Busters scurry away in shame. &lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/21/d7a835d2/lodge_-_buster_nohud_-_025.png" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;Calling to your buds when you spot the ghost and cramming it into a trap as a team is extremely satisfying. While the Busters can be temporarily incapacitated with slime, no one is ever stuck on the sidelines watching the rest of the match play out. There’s always hunting or blasting to do. The only low point on the Buster side is calming NPCs with the same VO lines ad nauseam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five ghost types account for a variety of play styles. Do you want to be quick and mischievous, go on the offensive with God of War-style chain attacks, or use tricks to manipulate and misdirect? All ghosts have a basic attack, a minion summon (for occupying Busters or frightening civilians), an ultimate move with a long cooldown, and a unique action that’s different for every skin. Possessing objects is key to hiding from Busters and recharging the energy you need to do pretty much anything. Experimenting with how everything handles is interesting, like a smooth rolling beer keg or a floppy giant teddy bear. While ghosts are extremely powerful and mobile, they’re also vulnerable to capture at any time. One minute you’ll be triumphantly sliming all four busters and sabotaging their Proton Packs, and the next you’ll be frantically mashing buttons to escape the pull of the streams and deadly traps. It’s a delight to hear opponents’ confusion while you stay out of sight, or their frustration as you cover the whole team in a whirlwind of slime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic firehouse serves as a multi-use hub when you’re not actively in matches. A handful of cutscenes tell a basic story through the game's early hours. The narrative is nothing to get excited about, but hearing Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson reprising their roles as Ray and Winston is nice. As you level up, you find new cosmetics, gear parts that affect stats, collectibles, and contracts that reward special items and experience bumps. Daily and weekly jobs encourage you to check in regularly as well. I found the steady flow of goodies kept my group dashing to the lockers to try on a new shirt or silly glasses between jobs. And the gear upgrades feel tangible, especially when your particle thrower can let loose for longer without overheating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the core gameplay is strong and engaging, I have concerns about Spirits Unleashed’s long-term sustainability. There’s only one match type, so if you get tired of that, you’re out of luck. The five current maps are solid, but I’m ready for more (IllFonic claims additional free maps and ghosts will roll out in the future). Story and unlocks keep things interesting during your first 30 character levels, but then the story comes to a hard stop. You’ll get all the core unlocks by 50. Beyond that, the current endgame consists of completing high-level contracts such as “do X-objective 25 times” and so on. Sometimes I would learn new aspects of the game I hadn’t realized before, but other times I’d be firing up bot matches hunting for floor waxers to shoot, or repeatedly throwing out my trap and picking it up to check off some annoying requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pre-release version of the game had some hard crashes, and I also got stuck in the geometry as a ghost a couple of times until the end of the match. I couldn’t replicate these issues after the day one patch, but it’s something to watch out for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal way to experience Spirits Unleashed is to round up your buddies, rotate through maps, take turns playing as the ghost, and proceed to hoot and holler. If that’s not an option, matchmaking with random players is smooth and quick, and in-game markers make teamwork possible even if everyone’s playing off-mic. The thrill of Ghostbusting eventually starts to wane, but it takes a while to get to that point, and updates down the road could help to keep those Proton Packs humming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: IllFonic Inc. provided game codes for this review.&lt;/p&gt;

      Everyone 10+
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;2017's Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle proved naysayers wrong by offering a well-crafted tactics game that successfully blends two very disparate franchises. Its sequel, Sparks of Hope, now must live up to fan excitement rather than dispel their doubt. Ubisoft Milan accomplishes this feat by returning to the drawing board, reworking its template, and creating a more streamlined, dynamic experience that maintains strategic depth. The core combat remains strong, but Ubisoft fleshed out the rest of the offerings to create a more wholly engaging package. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sparks of Hope plays identically to the last game; you’ll engage in tactical turn-based battles as a squad of Mario icons and their Rabbid doppelgängers. However, the grid-based movement is gone. Instead, you freely move your three-member team as you would in a standard third-person game. The game still restricts you to a character’s movement range, but positioning feels more natural and kinetic, expanding your offensive flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6308643932112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An optimal turn using a single hero often looks like this: I sprint toward a foe and slide into them for damage. I then retreat to a nearby ally to perform a team jump launching me airborne. I hover to a higher vantage point, activate a hero action such as Peach’s damage-negating shield, and move again. After finding new cover, I use my primary attack to blast another enemy before I’m finally forced to end my turn. I love how the looser framework allows me to squeeze more actions from a turn, and combat feels more exciting as a result. Chaining moves, such as launching targets into the range of, say, Mario’s automatic counterattack, adds to this satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plethora of colorful stages sometimes incorporates real-time elements that put this freedom to good use. One winter stage features timed wind gusts that blow players off the course. I avoid this by simply running past at the right times rather than adhering to a rigid turn order. One enemy explodes when killed, so I quickly flee its blast radius, again in real-time. Sparks of Hope also mixes up its objectives often enough to keep the action from getting too stagnant. I enjoy battling a giant rampaging Wiggler aboard a moving train or shattering dams with bombs to restore a region’s water flow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decently varied enemy roster and elaborate arenas mean battles remain thoughtful affairs where your positioning and offensive order of operations matter. Sparks of Hope offers enough challenge that poor planning can lead to a punishing team wipe. This time, however, you have the help of Sparks: hybrids of Rabbids and Super Mario Galaxy’s Lumas. Equipping these critters to heroes bestows a wide range of powers and perks, such as adding elemental traits to their attacks (like fire and ice). Other Sparks disrupt enemy formations by repelling or attracting foes. One of my favorites temporarily renders a character invisible. The most powerful Sparks unleash wide-reaching assaults, such as a fiery meteor shower. Feeding star bits to Sparks levels them up, letting you improve the capabilities of your favorites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since each hero can carry two Sparks, they feel more versatile as individuals resulting in more well-rounded teams. I love that I can have Rabbid Luigi handle foes weakened by shock and frost attacks on his own. I appreciate how enemy vulnerabilities forced me to constantly switch Sparks and prevent me from sticking with the same loadout or team out of complacency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also great that party building allows for any combination of heroes, ditching Kingdom Battle’s restriction of only using Mario and at least one Rabbid. Since heroes have inherent specialties – Luigi is a long-ranged sniper, Rabbid Peach serves as a healer, and Rabbid Mario doles up-close physical damage, for example – assembling squads feels more interesting since I can mix things up better. Heroes also have skill trees, which largely improve or enhance existing moves, that you can respec anytime, granting additional flexibility in what talents they bring to each fight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three newcomers join the fray: Bowser, Rabbid Rosalina, and Edge, a mysterious tough-as-nails Rabbid. They feel like good additions for the most part. Edge is my favorite, thanks to the high damage she deals by hurling her whirling blade to eviscerate lines of targets. Bowser and his Bow-zooka rocket launcher make him a punishing tank that can obliterate groups and cover terrain. Rabbid Rosalina’s lackadaisical personality is amusing, but I often struggle to find a spot for her. She conjures debilitating effects that hinder or outright stop foes in their tracks, but her machine-gun-like doll doesn’t feel like it satisfies a particular need.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/20/6c9c884f/mario_rabbids_soh_plain.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/20/b9538cb3/mario_rabbids_soh_rabbid_peach.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/20/3ad80c80/mario_rabbids_soh_mario_cover.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/20/6eb0353d/1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_group.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/06/29/b48037b9/mario_rabbids_mario_gunplay.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/20/d970f174/mario_rabbis_soh_cursa.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/06/29/678e3893/mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_fireballs.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;Expanded overworld exploration adds more engagement outside the battlefield. Multiple themed planets, such as a tropical beach or a mechanic’s junkyard, are packed with sidequests, puzzles, and secrets. I like that I’m not required to complete quests to progress. You’re free to mainline the sizable critical path, and you’ll largely remain appropriately leveled. But if you do, you’ll miss out on earning planet coins (native currency unlocking special keys, weapon skins, and more), useful combat items like POW blocks, and more Sparks. Tasks include helping a DJ find his missing records, solving a series of entertaining riddles for an enthusiastic explorer, or chasing and catching fish in a timed minigame. These missions aren’t the deepest, and I wish some had more variety; expect to fulfill the same “kill X-amount of X-enemy type” task on each world. But they’re enjoyable enough and can be welcome breaks from constant battling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the most fun upgrading my robotic companion, Beep-0, with new abilities used to unlock inaccessible areas. Along the way, I acquired a sonic pulse to shatter weak walls and move blocks and a special light that exposes invisible paths and treasures. These abilities give Sparks of Hope’s worlds a light Metroid feel in that I regularly revisited destinations to unlock new zones. Solving environmental puzzles is also fun, offering adequate challenges without feeling tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A charming though uneventful narrative about stopping a cosmic darkness from consuming the galaxy rounds out this delightful package. Like the best sequels, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>New Tales From The Borderlands Review – Forgettable Story, Unforgettable Characters

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;One of my biggest gripes with the mainline Borderlands series is its humor. I’ve had some good laughs while playing, but Borderlands’ jokes land more like a shotgun blast where some hit and others don’t. That’s okay in bursts, but shotgun blast after shotgun blast can get exhausting. Telltale Games’ take on this universe, Tales From The Borderlands, remedied this by providing a more nuanced and subtle take on the humor coursing through the franchise’s veins. It became one of my favorite Borderlands games, with a great story and memorable characters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to report Gearbox’s take on that formula in New Tales From The Borderlands retains that same sense of humor with a vastly improved visual style more in line with the series’ latter entries. It also features a cast just as memorable – I already want more of them. Unfortunately, though, the entire package is let down by a lackluster overarching narrative lacking cohesion, and I’m left wishing Gearbox gave these characters a better story to exist within.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Tales From The Borderlands features a few familiar faces and names with Tales From The Borderlands’ Rhys, now CEO of gun-manufacturer Atlas, and other mega-corporations like Maliwan and Tediore. Most of the game takes place on Promethea, which Borderlands 3 players should recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/6104b228/ntftb_launch_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/a6fe9b8b/ntftb_launch_4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/1d4f94ec/ntftb_launch_3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/b6574a76/lheader.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Altruistic but internally selfish scientist Anu teams up with her adopted street-smart brother Octavio, his assassination bot LOU13, and Fran’s Frogurt owner Fran. Together, they aim to protect Promethea from a Tediore invasion, secure a hidden vault treasure and, ultimately, attempt to create and change the world with an anti-gun device. The story sets this up quite nicely in the first episode of this five-part story, and I was excited to see where it went. But just a few hours later, I was left confused.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without spoiling anything, the story bounces between seemingly random subplots that feel unimportant to the primary conflict. At one point, I’m desperate to dodge a Tediore invasion. Then, an hour later, I’m on a Shark Tank-like game show trying to pitch Anu’s&amp;nbsp;device to investors. And then, my primary concern is seemingly to open a business amidst the rubble of the Tediore invasion that’s still ongoing. I wanted more of the save-the-world narrative the first episode set up, but the side beats and steps along the way are distracting and loosely attached more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story does wrap itself up nicely, with a sweet moment of a bow on top, and by the time the credits rolled, I was happy to have experienced what this squad of characters went through. I just wish the entire game featured the cohesion I felt in the first and final episodes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/58c187f5/ntftb_world.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/9e249884/ntftb_atlus_ship.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/49568520/ntftb_launch_5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/8250a42f/ntftb_launch_6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Story aside, New Tales From The Borderlands features four of my new favorite characters in this universe. Anu is funny and quirky in a classic scientist-getting-in-the-way-of-herself way, and some late-game revelations add more depth to her personality that I appreciate. Octavio plays it cool, and I had fun shaping the kind of “cool” he is with my choices. Fran is a sexually-confident middle-aged woman who’s put aside subtlety in favor of outright telling people, “we should bone.” She feels the most like a classic Borderlands character – with a handful of fart jokes, too (admittedly, one of these made me laugh a lot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOU13 was my favorite, though. His deadpan humor and his journey to break free from the parameters of his assassination programming kept me smiling the entire way through. Each character shined in their own ways when isolated, but together, my favorite conversations in the whole game took place, letting each riff on the others in unique ways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the success of these moments came down to Gearbox’s excellent character writing and the choices the game presented me with at both trivial and pivotal moments in the narrative. I could set Fran up with a big power play of a remark when arrested by Tediore troops, or I could just have her answer questions by making fart noises. I enjoyed crafting my take on each of these characters and Gearbox, much like Telltale, excelled in that regard.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/ee5339a6/ntftb_group.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/fb60a919/ntftb_anu_stapleface.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/fd992a72/ntftb_gp_anu.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/fa5d09d3/ntftb_gp_octavio.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/e406dca9/ntftb_susan.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly gone are the Telltale “this person will remember” notifications. In theory, this is a nice touch, as it removes that gamified element from the formula and allows the player to live with their choices without knowing how they affect the story. In practice, though, I missed them. Without these tip-offs, save for a few random ones that occur without explanation, I felt like I had lost a touch of agency. Sure, I was picking the choices I wanted, but I struggled to piece together how my actions affected the grander narrative. The instant reactions were there; it was easy to tell if Octavio, for example, didn’t like what Anu said. But how my actions precisely changed the broader narrative remained a mystery. I had guesses throughout, but I wonder if Decision X led to Consequence Y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wasn’t impressed by what I was doing when I wasn’t selecting dialogue choices. Gameplay boils down to swiping left, right, up, or down, or pressing a button, mashing it repeatedly, or holding it down. Occasionally, you can walk around a small area to find money or talk with locals, but these didn’t do much for me. This type of adventure gameplay was the standard years ago at the height of Telltale’s development, but it feels old now, and I wanted more variety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasional minigames, such as a parody of a turn-based JRPG, or another where I had to hack into a computer by removing NSFW spam on a screen, helped in that regard, but I still wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/b296aae5/ntftb_vaultlander.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/45e84107/ntftb_fran.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/705aac5d/ntftb_lou13.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/f89236c2/ntftb_octavio.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/0f3d4be2/ntftb_vault.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/19/b56543c9/ntftb_launch_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Vaultlanders, a minigame that appears multiple times in each episode, is a fun minifigure-based fighting game but only for the first few times. There are Vaultlander figures to collect in each episode, and each has its own stats and abilities, but it matters little. I never struggled to defeat an enemy and never worried about my abilities or stats. That’s because playing involves mindlessly spamming the attack button and occasionally dodging by swiping a direction when the enemy attacks. Like all the other minigames, this one can be skipped entirely, but I was eager to find a purpose for its inclusion in the game and played through each one. Unfortunately, I didn’t find a purpose, and these quickly became pace-breaking annoyances I had to deal with when I just wanted to get back to the story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, by the time my 10-hour journey in New Tales From The Borderlands ended, I was happy to have experienced it. There’s good in there, but it’s sometimes muddled by dated mechanics that feel more obligatory because Telltale did them in the previous game rather than something necessary to its enjoyment. The cast is excellent, and as a character-driven experience, this game excels. I just wished Gearbox propped them up with a story as strong as their individual arcs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, New Tales From The Borderlands feels like more of the same&amp;nbsp;and fans of the first are likely to enjoy this, but given it’s been nearly eight years since that first one, I wanted more of an evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Batman may be dead, but his mission carries on as Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, and Red Hood take up the calling to protect Gotham. Pulling the most well-known and popular character of the mythology from the mix comes with some notable downsides, as much of the pathos and psychological drama goes with him. However, the young generation of heroes manages to put on a relatively good show even without their mentor along for the ride, albeit one that feels like it’s not quite in the same league as the Dark Knight’s greatest adventures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gotham Knights is not part of the celebrated Arkham series, but enough similarities exist that you’d be excused for thinking otherwise. Players take their chosen hero on nightly patrols across a large but not especially lively Gotham, halting crimes, helping allies, and hunting down clues. The freedom of exploration across a vast cityscape is inviting, but the space feels empty and lacking in memorable locales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty to do on your patrols, from gathering lost Batarangs to completing races on your Batcycle. But as the hours wore on, I increasingly felt like the gradual leveling and mission structure were heavy on busy work and light on original and exciting moments or reveals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several more established mission locations are scattered across the game, where storytelling and structured encounters are more common. But even these felt extremely linear, lacking in the ingenious encounter problem solving the game needs. Even so, it’s fun to see some of the most enjoyable rogues show up, from individuals like Harley Quinn and Penguin to groups like the mysterious Court of Owls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6313413096112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat and stealth work mechanically well but lack the breadth of creativity that makes predator-style combat experiences so fun. I had too few tools to manipulate and terrify my foes while in hiding, and combat too frequently devolved into the same timed button press combos. Momentum abilities (unlocked over time) add flash and flexibility to combat. However, even with those special tricks up my sleeve, as the game drives toward its climax, enemies increasingly take too long to bring down, and fights drag on unpleasantly. Even knowing this is a different game, I consistently longed for the more nuanced encounters of earlier Arkham games.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to watch a cast of characters who were originally sidekicks all rally together to step into lead roles. The sense of family camaraderie works, and all the characters can hold their own as they venture forth onto solo missions. But from the dialogue to the storytelling beats, I couldn’t escape the feeling that I was experiencing “Batman Jr.,” with a tone that feels out of step with the dark setting. Nothing has quite the gravitas it needs to land.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rewarding progression system offers many ways to tweak your characters; the plethora of awesome suit designs is especially fun. I enjoyed crafting new weapons and modding them with my preferred bonuses. Each character also has a unique ability tree; the further into the game I explored, the more each character felt distinct in playstyle. I liked most of them, except for Red Hood, whose slightly slower movements and focus on ranged weapons didn’t really click.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. Montreal deserves significant praise for its approach to two-person cooperative play. The drop-in, drop-out experience is seamless and enjoyable, readily adjusting difficulty so that both players are on par. Players can work in tandem in a single fight or range far across the city from one another – without a hitch. It’s a multiplayer system that works so smoothly that you won’t notice any complications beyond the chance to beat up some bad guys with a buddy – and that’s as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gotham Knights didn’t wow me with its overly familiar objectives, combat, and activities, but it didn’t leave me sour. It’s fun to control some new heroes as they brood over Gotham from its building overhangs and uncover hidden plots against its people. Those heroes are right to wonder if they’re living up to a vaunted legacy. And even if they’re not quite up to snuff, Gotham has enough baddies to punch to make for a good time, whoever you are.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt;
      Mature
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Going into A Plague Tale: Requiem, developer Asobo Studio’s follow-up to 2019’s A Plague Tale: Innocence, I was prepared for the usual jump in quality and scale that most sequels embrace. I underestimated just how significant that leap would be, though. Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic. It feels Odyssean in scope and storytelling prowess. Although much of it came together for me by the end of my 20-plus hour journey through medieval France, the game feels strained by its sheer size, especially in its first half. Still, I’m more impressed by Requiem’s boldness and near across-the-board improvements than not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requiem begins roughly six months after the events of Innocence, and while it is possible to piece together what’s happening if you’re new to the series, I’d really recommend playing Innocence or at least getting caught up on its story before Requiem. Siblings Amicia and Hugo de Rune are looking for a semblance of an ordinary life, despite Hugo’s rat-infested Macula condition. And for some time, the game demonstrates what that normality is like for Amicia, Hugo, and their mother. Still, as you might guess, the Macula plague begins to rear its ugly head once more, forcing Amicia back into protector mode. This shift sees Amicia, Hugo, and returning alchemist Lucas travel south to a mysterious island, searching for answers and a cure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was excited about this change in setting and all the “new” it brings to the series, but it takes far too long to reach it. At least half of this game is spent escaping your new home to reach a boat that sails to the island. Don’t get me wrong, these 10 to 12 hours are good Plague Tale fun, but they resemble Innocence so much that, at times, it hardly felt like the fresh experience I expected from a sequel. It mostly dragged on, even though I was meeting characters that would become some of my favorites in the game, like battle-hardened but soft-hearted Arnaud or pirate queen Sophia. It didn’t help that I experienced various technical issues like distracting (but not game-breaking) framerate drops, visual bugs, and one complete hard crash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reaching the island, though, my thoughts changed entirely. The story ramps up in pace and excitement, introducing new allies and villains, a cult, intriguing lore, and a new mystery to wrap my head around. Even mechanically, the isle represents a miniature open world to explore that’s more sprawling than any other area in the series. The way the game’s narrative pulls you here and there on this island is good fun, whether you’re solving the mystery of ancient underground ruins or fighting off secretive slavers awaiting the Child of Embers. By the end of my playtime, I felt like I intimately knew its layout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part of the game impressed me the most because everything is firing on all cylinders. Ingenious puzzles that let you manipulate the rats’ aversion to fire to make them stealthily take down enemies always satisfied me – using a special projectile to extinguish an enemy’s sole flame, allowing the rats to feast on their live body, never grew old. The story’s twists and turns kept me guessing, as did the island’s central mystery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requiem is visually stunning, too, as Asobo has crafted an almost painterly look for the game with unique and playful color palettes that complement the medieval setting excellently. I recall a moment when it seemed like everything around the de Runes was crashing down atop them, and Requiem represented that visually with a unique, almost grayscale, palette that heightened the enclosing metaphorical darkness. In other moments, I found myself stopping to tinker with photo mode to capture the colorful beauty of blooming flowers on the coast of this scenic island. Requiem really is a treat for the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Crash Bandicoot-like sequences that see Amicia fleeing from massive hordes of rats toward the screen, or sprinting in the opposite direction to safety, were especially welcomed breaks from the game’s otherwise quieter but stressful stealth moments. These segments speak to the more bombastic nature of Requiem, which at times goes to places I could outright spoil here, and I don’t think you’d believe me anyway. Again, I want to stress how epic Requiem’s scale and size are – it’s bigger than Innocence in every way.  Even beyond the story, new additions to Amicia and Hugo’s arsenal, like a one-hit-kill crossbow (don’t rely on it too much, though, because arrows are tough to come by) or Hugo’s ability to control rats and feast on the enemies around you, up the ante of the moment-to-moment gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, despite what I enjoyed upon reaching the island, I can’t help but feel that Asobo could have cut a large portion of this game. That’s not to say the sections I want trimmed are bad – they’re good due to A Plague Tale’s quality gameplay and storytelling – but they feel more like unnecessary padding that hinders Requiem’s pacing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was relieved when Requiem’s second set of credits rolled. Not because I didn’t enjoy playing the game, but because the de Runes’ journey in this game is tense and stressful for much of it. At times, it feels too long and oddly sadistic in its focus on inflicting fakeouts, pain, and suffering on the de Runes. Other times, I admired Asobo’s command of this series, its rat-infested stealth mechanics, and its grandiose storytelling. Fortunately, the latter edges out the former, and Requiem feels like much more than just a follow-up. With this journey behind me, I’m excited about where the series might go from here, but if Asobo plans a break for the franchise, rest assured that Requiem goes out with an impressive bang.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Overwatch took the gaming world by storm when it launched in 2016, thanks to its well-balanced roster of unique heroes and terrific objective-based, first-person-shooting gameplay. The game’s popularity endured through the years thanks to a wealth of new content like characters, maps, cosmetics, and game modes, adding to the terrific foundation. However, once the content dried up for Overwatch, the public interest followed shortly afterward. Overwatch 2 represents the re-emergence of one of the top multiplayer games of the last generation, delivering a 5v5 format, a free-to-play structure, and a ton of new content. The result is an action-packed and enjoyable progression of the beloved hero-shooter franchise, but one that feels less revolutionary and more iterative than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rdnY3VxAoqU" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core gameplay feels simultaneously familiar and fresh. Capturing an objective with a coordinated assault or activating your Ultimate during a crucial last-second push to secure the victory is just as breathtakingly exciting as ever. The ways the heroes interact with each other – both in gameplay and personality – create watercooler moments I imagine I’ll bring up with my fellow players for years to come. The mechanics and match flow remain mostly intact, but developer Blizzard implemented various changes to the core formula to deliver something that changes how battles play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new 5v5 format is perhaps the most significant change in Overwatch. Now, traditional team comps drop to one tank, making its role as a damage sponge and utility player more critical than ever. With Doomfist now a tank and Orisa reworked to be more offense-minded, you now have a broader range to choose from in the category. Outside of tank play, this 5v5 format opens the door for faster-paced blitzes and ensures that every player carries more importance in each match. This shift is particularly evident in Push, the new game mode where players escort a robot to the other team’s spawn point. This mode is fast-paced and can swing the other way quickly, playing perfectly into the new 5v5 format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you first jump into Overwatch 2, you can expect a ton of new content right out of the gate: three heroes, six maps, a game mode, and more than 30 skins. The new heroes and maps are stellar additions to the preexisting lineups; Junker Queen and Sojourn are formidable in battle, but Kiriko, with her substantial healing and buffing capabilities and deadly kunai attack, is one of my favorite support heroes to date. When you combine these new characters with the reworks of longtime favorites like Orisa, Doomfist, Zarya, and Bastion, the roster feels refreshed, and the meta flipped on its head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever a formerly premium title becomes free-to-play, players are rightfully wary, thanks to predatory monetization schemes that permeate the category. While players should still approach Overwatch 2’s shift to free-to-play with caution, Blizzard keeps the paywall-locked content cosmetic. The best part is that players no longer must cross their fingers for anything but duplicate cosmetics in their loot boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6312930144112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, loot boxes are replaced by an in-game shop and Battle Pass, which progresses by completing in-game challenges. These objectives range from winning a game playing as a healer to using a specific character’s Ultimate three times; some challenges refresh daily, others weekly, and others on a seasonal basis, ensuring you always have new goals towards which to strive. Each time you complete a challenge, you gain experience towards the next tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress accumulates steadily regardless of if you pay the $10 (or the equivalent of in-game coins) for the boosted premium Battle Pass. However, it’s disappointing that you need to reach level 55 of the free Battle Pass to unlock that season’s new hero; if you purchase premium, the hero joins your roster at level 1. The rest of the rewards are cosmetic, but with so many exclusive to the premium pass, non-paying players may find limited satisfaction from this new structure. And with seasons lasting nine weeks, those who buy each premium Battle Pass at $10 will eclipse the $60 MSRP of the original Overwatch in just over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m certainly wary of this new system going forward, for now, the structure seems like a reasonable alternative to the previous framework. Thanks to a sneak peek of the content on the horizon, Blizzard has impressive plans for its resurgent hero shooter, and I like the existing challenge system. However, I most appreciate the intentionality in unlocking rewards, which starkly contrasts Overwatch 1’s loot box system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who never played the first Overwatch have additional hurdles, like needing to unlock the original heroes by playing a set number of matches. Blizzard bills this as a way to fend off cheaters since it’s now free to start a new account. But it ultimately feels like punishment for not paying the price for the first game. The silver lining is that this drip-feed approach could onboard new players without overwhelming them with many characters to learn. However, requiring players to complete up to 130 matches to unlock the full roster feels steep. Thankfully, wins count double towards that number, and you can use the original heroes in custom games. Plus, if you enjoy Overwatch 2’s moment-to-moment gameplay as much as I do, those unlock requirements fly by. Still, I’m glad I didn’t have to complete them as a returning player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overwatch 2 doesn’t flip the formula the way you might expect a long-awaited, numbered sequel would. But through various clever tweaks, it’s a well-rounded evolution of the experience into which I’ve poured more than a thousand hours since 2016. I may never recreate the magic of those first few years in Overwatch, but Overwatch 2 is a big step towards restoring the faith in the franchise and has me thinking it’s time to pour a few more hundred hours into my favorite team-based shooter.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Much like my Liverpool fandom over the past 20 years, I vacillate between happily obsessive and begrudgingly bewildered with FIFA. Like Liverpool, when FIFA works like a well-oiled machine, play on the field is beautiful, slick, and drives my football-loving brain to elation with dopamine hits. However, FIFA 23 feels like FIFA 22, which was similar to FIFA 21, with additions ranging from mildly impactful to invigorating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIFA has focused on one facet of soccer for years: the attack. It’s almost arcade-like when you feel how quickly and smoothly players change pace from a controlled dribble to a sprint. Cross-field balls behind defenders for a winger to rush onto are exhilarating. The much-debated trick stick is hard to master, but even a couple of flicks can launch an audacious stepover or the famous Maradona spin to beat a defender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EA’s HyperMotion2 technology enables more natural animations between dribbling and shooting, but it’s barely noticeable even during replays. Most goals look similar to those scored in FIFA 22, which isn’t bad. It’s just that HyperMotion2 doesn’t revolutionize the presentation, making it feel like just another yearly update that is just a bit smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/03/6a847e27/fifa4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/03/e1ed871f/fifa5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/03/7c51066a/fifa7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/03/fcb9ca0a/fifa3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/03/efe9273d/fifa1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/03/8e331293/fifa2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;One positive addition this year is the ability to play “Moments” in Ultimate Team. Reminiscent of FIFA 2006 World Cup’s global challenge mode, you play different scenarios, like overcoming a two-goal deficit beginning with a penalty kick in the 70th minute of a match. These scenarios reward stars used to unlock cards like Ted Lasso and his right-hand-man Coach Beard for Ultimate Team. It’s a fun and quick way to grind for cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chemistry in Ultimate Team provides stat boosts to your players if you assemble a team with players in the correct position and of the same nationality or league, and it accumulates differently this year. Players can earn up to three chemistry points, but this time, you can hit chemistry maxes with, for example, an English attack and a La Liga backline, allowing for more satisfying and creative team building.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Career mode is more robust this year, offering fun for those looking to go through a season solo with their created avatar or a real-world player. Players must complete targets set in-game to please the manager, but it still feels like only scoring and assisting matter to your rating instead of simply staying in position and completing passes. What does spruce it up quite a bit is the addition of Playable Highlights during your player or manager career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3V-GvvzjE4" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You take control during the Playable Highlight to try to score or stop the opposition from putting the ball in the back of the net. These fun little snapshots of a match let you change a simulated 2-0 outcome to a 4-0 one, but it does make it harder to hit your avatar’s goals as you will mostly control others on the team. Off the pitch, you can sign investment deals to earn money and partake in activities to bolster your stats or earn points in either the Maverick, Virtuoso, or Heartbeat personality types. Each unlocks different skills for your player, like stamina or volleying ability, based on whether you prefer dribbling, passing, or shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding women’s club soccer is long overdue, but it doesn’t bring the attention it deserves. You have a scant number of national teams, plus the professional French and English leagues, for use in classic matches, seasons, and cups. However, they aren’t in Career or Ultimate Team, meaning if you were hoping to pair up Alex Morgan and Jordan Pefok on your FUT squad, you’re out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a famous saying from former footballer Gary Lineker that “football is a simple game – 22 men chase a ball for 90 minutes – and at the end, the Germans always win.” I want to make a similar assessment of EA’s yearly soccer game: FIFA 23 is a good game – it’s flashy, fun to play, and has a lot of modes –&amp;nbsp;but in the end, you realize it’s mostly the same game you’ve been playing for years.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Dorfromantik Review – Falling Into Place

              &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Once you get past its bizarre name, Dorfromantik offers simple, relaxing sessions of tile-matching puzzle goodness. Connecting hexagons to build pretty landscapes offers the thoughtful strategy of a city-builder to provide a stimulating yet overwhelmingly Zen atmosphere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fans of the board game Carcassonne should quickly grasp Dorfromantik's concept of drawing random tiles and finding high-scoring – and aesthetically pleasing – ways to place them on the field based on their scenery. Tiles only fit next to those with corresponding edges; railroad tiles connect with railroads, rivers merge with other bodies of water, and so on. Creating expansive forests or sprawling villages reward more points, and I enjoy the challenge of finding optimal ways to make pieces fit. Completing sections of the map and watching boats sail across my pretzel-like waterways is a small but satisfying touch because of how it brings my model cities to life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic experience presents objectives, such as building towns to a specific size, to provide nuggets of purpose to make the otherwise freeform experience engaging. You don’t have to complete these tasks, but I always delight in closing the loop on a plot of land I spent ages building up and watching my score skyrocket. Expanding your board can unlock new types of tiles, such as windmills, water wheels, and even new biomes to spice up the draw pool. Seeing the field evolve from the standard lush green to a patchwork of darker, barren earth or snow-frosted trees freshens the visual variety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6313204648112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate how Dorfromantik's selection of modes provides several options for enjoying the experience based on my mood. A Creative Mode allows for building without restriction, even letting you discard ill-fitting tiles. Conversely, Hard Mode offers a steeper challenge with more complex pieces. Quick Mode condenses the game into shorter sessions, great for knocking out quick rounds while on the go. The Monthly Mode mixes up the game long-term with new batches of custom rules each month.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a substantial amount of time playing the PC version of Dorfromantik when it launched in early access last year. The experience translates well to Switch, though using controller inputs to move tiles and the camera is, unsurprisingly, less intuitive than the snappy precision of a mouse. It's not bad by any means, though it is my least preferred way to play. That said, it's a fair trade-off for the perk of tile-matching in bed or on the couch. Plus, the simple yet colorful art direction, which has a hand-drawn quality, pops on the small screen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorfromantik balances its strategic and cozy elements well, and it's easy to fall into a serene trance of dropping tiles. Pulling the camera back to reveal the full scope of my landscape always feels like a satisfying reward for my subtle, hard work, much like stepping back to admire a finished painting. While it's not the sort of puzzle game I feel compelled to play more than a session or two a day, I always appreciate the improved mood with which it leaves me.&lt;/p&gt;

      Switch, PC, iOS

      Yacht Club Games
      &lt;br /&gt;
              &lt;b&gt;Developer:&lt;/b&gt;
      Nitrome, Yacht Club Games
      &lt;br /&gt;
              &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The second I began Shovel Knight Dig, it felt like returning home. As someone who hadn’t played most of Shovel Knight’s post-launch DLC, the last time I touched this series was nearly a decade ago. Gaining control of the titular character immediately felt familiar, and my old Shovel Knight habits returned to greet this new take on the series, led by developer Nitrome this time. The moment-to-moment experience plays excellently, in part because it’s more Shovel Knight with some well-designed gameplay twists. However, the game’s venture into roguelite territory feels inessential and so light-stepped that it didn’t convince me it needed to be a part of this ever-expanding genre. Still, Shovel Knight Dig is more Shovel Knight, meaning retro-game and platforming enthusiasts will find great enjoyment throughout.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than moving right through a beautifully pixelated stage, Dig tasks players with digging down, deeper and deeper into procedurally generated levels. This presents new feelings in the pantheon of emotions I feel while playing a Shovel Knight game: urgency and stress. Unlike many platformers out there, you can’t take the time to observe where you must go and how best to get there. You have to keep digging down and while going back up a few spaces is possible, it’s not easy. You’re not meant to backtrack because your goal is far below you. If you miss some gems or one of the stage’s three machine cogs, which unlock a special bonus reward, you probably missed your chance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/29/7f47dd12/screenshot_02.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/29/00bbd8f7/screenshot_03.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/29/8f87822e/screenshot_04.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/29/77dd122b/screenshot_05.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/29/814ec275/screenshot_06.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, if you spend too long in any one place, the antagonist Drill Knight will use a massive one-hit-kill excavation machine to bury you deeper into the Smeltworks, Secret Fountain, Grub Pit, or one of the game’s other stages. I like this added stress to Dig’s platforming, which largely feels identical to that of the original Shovel Knight game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing three stages in a given lair, you face a boss. I love these boss fights, but they’re disappointing in the context of Dig. They feel like Shovel Knight bosses, fast-paced and fun, but they don’t take advantage of the new mechanics specific to Dig. You jump around an arena attempting to damage a boss while dodging their attacks. Only the final boss implements the game’s unique dig platforming mechanics and I wish this type of design was present in the multiple other opponents I faced before this one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hours I spent digging down through stage after stage, I rarely felt like I was playing a roguelite. It was only when I died and returned to above ground, which is where a camp of NPCs you’ve met and shopkeepers reside, that I was reminded of the game’s tip-toe into roguelite mechanics. You lose your stage progress and some of your gems upon death, but these losses are so minuscule that I never felt compelled to go out of my way to retrieve my lost currency in the next run.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/29/da753b45/screenshot_07.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/29/b17efd69/screenshot_08.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/29/68bfb9ea/screenshot_09.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/29/ad8bf52e/screenshot_10.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/29/124f397a/screenshot_01.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;I also never felt the need to equip new sets of armor, which can only be purchased after finding templates of them in secret areas scattered throughout the various stages. In fact, the only permanent upgrade I could make was to my bag, which allowed me to hold onto more than one item, like a door or chest key, at a time. Part of the fun of a roguelite is tracking your progression and growing more powerful each run, but in Dig, each run felt like a brand new start. I didn’t hate this, but it’s not my cup of tea.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still though, because most of my eight hours with Dig were spent spelunking through stages leading down, I rarely had to think about the game’s roguelite efforts. I spent most of my time playing through beautiful stages to the tune of chippy synth tunes, fascinated with how far Nitrome and Yacht Club were able to stretch the “dig” aspect of this game. Perhaps the roguelite nature of Dig will play a bigger role in my post-game excavations because I’m rearing to jump back in to discover all of its secrets. Even if it doesn’t, though, I know I still have at least a few more hours of great Shovel Knight gameplay ahead of me and in the world of platforming, that’s a treasure worth digging up.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;"I'm Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the moment Guybrush uttered this iconic line in Return to Monkey Island and our reintroduction to familiar characters like used ship salesman Stan S. Stanman and Cobb, with his "Ask me about Loom" badge, I was already shrouded in a haze of nostalgia. And you would be eating all these up, too, if you're a Monkey Island fan. The thing about Monkey Island enthusiasts is that we can talk your ears off about what makes the series so unique. It's the earnest naivety of its pirate hero Guybrush Threepwood and the series' whimsical and self-referential humor. But most of all, it's that one absurd puzzle you'll need to crack within the original Secret of Monkey Island: the sheer hilarity of transporting an ultra tart blend of a pirate beverage called grog across an island without melting its mug and incinerating your hands along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's still plenty of such fondness to reminisce about in Return to Monkey Island, a point-and-click adventure game that hasn't lost any of its luster and immense charm since creator Ron Gilbert's last Monkey Island game, which is close to 30 years old. It feels like time has barely passed since then, with the premise of its swashbuckling tale faithfully crafted from a Monkey Island structure that feels refined to near perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guybrush is heading to the eponymous island in search of its greatest secret, and he is again in need of a boat and crew. He drops by Melee Island, the favorite haunt of any self-professed Mighty Pirate and others in the Caribbean, and runs into a couple of old friends and less-than-friends there. The Voodoo Lady makes several dramatic proclamations about the nature of Guybrush's ill-fated expedition, with him eventually scrapping up whatever resources he can for his voyage to Monkey Island. Hijinks, which may involve the ingenious use of chicken and other fowl-related products, ensue. You get the drift. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6312941314112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essence of Monkey Island lies in its trademark goofy panache and a genuine sense of humor, with which Return to Monkey Island radiates. It's challenging to go into specifics without veering into spoiler territory, but there are a plethora of playful jokes and self-aware gags that left me wheezing due to the game's impeccable comedic timing. One early scenario, meant to introduce the ability to skip through dialogue quickly, has you listening to a rambling monologue about anchors' exquisite function, history, and beauty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return to Monkey Island strings its punchlines with remarkable comedic timing. There are setups for jokes that pay off to ludicrous conclusions at a later time. There are tons of fourth-wall-breaking references poking fun at everything from pop culture to the idiosyncrasies of video games. There are throwbacks to past gags like the eye-watering, immaterial textures of Stan's jacket, which never stops being funny. Such humor is more than just skin-deep; it's thoroughly infused into every part of Return to Monkey Island, from its eccentric cast of characters to the way its puzzles play out, like a particular quest involving a mop, some grease, and a tiny hole. Return to Monkey Island oozes personality, with plenty of charisma to spare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the series' popularity, it would have been easy for Gilbert and his studio, Terrible Toybox, to create a new Monkey Island game that simply banks on its fans' sentimentality for the series – a knowing wink, some inside jokes, or breadcrumbs alluding to long-running gags in Monkey Island (and there are so many of them). But while Return to Monkey Island is a sequel to Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge, Terrible Toybox isn't content to just let the game serve as an elaborate throwback to the earlier games. &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/27/6df22d61/mi9.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/27/b82ad57e/mi7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/27/01742d2a/mi6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/27/7fc3a0fd/mi5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/27/0f011532/mi1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/27/52dc6aa9/mi2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/27/25df5c0b/mi3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;Notably, there's the game's refreshed art style. Far from a stark departure from the spirit of the series, this feels more like a much-needed coat of fresh paint on a beloved but legacy series, emblematic of the new-yet-familiar direction that Return to Monkey Island is taking. Take, for instance, the scrapbook, a nifty feature that briefly recounts the colorful exploits of the famed Mighty Pirate, meant to ease new players into the game and serve as a recap for a series that spanned three entire decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also a hint system that's brilliantly woven into the story, and it's meticulously considered and immensely helpful for folks like myself who can get driven into a corner by its puzzles, and it doesn't reveal all the answers at once. Clues, presented through a spellbook, are gradually revealed depending on the obstacles you're facing, encouraging you to discover the solutions to the puzzles on your own. This is done by presenting keywords that may inspire a solution – an epiphany, perhaps – or through vague clues that gently nudge you in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there's the refreshing point-and-click interface, which is more intuitive than the antiquated "nine verbs" menu of traditional point-and-click titles. No longer will you haphazardly drag random knick-knacks to these verbs to inadvertently discover what you can do with them; this new interface streamlines such interactions to examining or using these objects. As a result, Guybrush's bits of humor and quips associated with misusing these items in the older Monkey Island games vanish in this title. You will no longer be able to talk to random artifacts you grabbed off the shelf or mash unrelated things together. Fortunately, such gags are largely inconsequential in the first place (you shouldn't worry, anyway; Return to Monkey Island is a wellspring of great jokes). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even select between two difficulty modes, which lets you choose between an experience that prioritizes the story over its puzzles or another for puzzle enthusiasts who prefer a bit of a brain teaser. The sum of these parts points to an incredibly thoughtful design that makes Return to Monkey Island an adventure anyone can dive into – one that can be equally delightful to new players, especially for those who may be concerned about trudging into a series with decades of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, distilling it to its components wouldn't quite encapsulate the splendor of this Monkey Island sequel. Instead, I would point out that Return to Monkey Island feels like a homecoming, of returning to those sepia-toned days where I first relived the exciting adventures of the intrepid Guybrush Threepwood in The Secret of Monkey Island many years ago. It's also why, despite Terrible Toybox's gallant efforts to make Return of Monkey Island more approachable to new players, it's still the original series fans who would get the most out of this point-and-click experience. They're the very folks who will be delighted to catch a glimpse of, say, the same scrap of melted metal that Guybrush once used to hold his grog as they briefly recall the absurdity of that puzzle in their heads. Return to Monkey Island is profoundly nostalgic and relentlessly funny, and I'm once again a kid, laughing at Guybrush's umpteenth last-ditch efforts to distract his opponents with, "Look behind you, a three-headed monkey!"&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Tinykin smartly blends platforming and puzzle-solving with the minion management of Nintendo's Pikmin series. Players control a flea-sized astronaut who travels from his home &lt;a&gt;planet&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;to Earth to trace humanity’s true origins. The explorer’s journey takes him to an ordinary home occupied by sentient insects who worship a mysterious deity. To return home, the astronaut must assemble a rocket by gathering ordinary household objects with the help of small, adorable aliens called Tinykin. As a fan of “little person in a big world” experiences, Tinykin’s premise and world drew me in, and its gameplay satisfied me until its conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best, though perhaps reductive, way to describe Tinykin’s gameplay would be “Pikmin as a platformer.” Each room in the house offers large, smartly laid-out playgrounds where players overcome platforming challenges and solve environmental puzzles using different types of Tinykin. These include pink varieties that carry objects, red versions that explode on impact when tossed, and green Tinykin that stack vertically to form a living ladder, among others. I like how the game introduces each Tinykin one stage at a time, letting me spend an entire level getting used to their unique talents before introducing another.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6312885159112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The well-crafted puzzles become better (and more involved) as you recruit more Tinykin to your ranks. Some obstacles can be as simple as carrying an oversized appliance out of your path. Other tasks become scavenger hunts, challenging you to find creative ways of traversing the world to locate and retrieve scattered items. Solutions tend to be relatively straightforward, no matter what form a puzzle takes; Tinykin never forces you to wrack your brain, at least not for very long. I found this level of challenge relaxing but engaging enough to avoid becoming mundane or overly simplistic. Tinykin’s puzzle-solving has a nice flow that keeps the experience moving, making it a breeze to get through.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controlling the Tinykin is simple and intuitive, requiring little more than aiming and flinging them at designated targets. I also love that Tinykin can perform jobs independently, allowing me to multitask. It feels great to let a dozen helpers work on lugging objects to their destinations while I gleefully collect scattered pollen (used to upgrade a hover ability), find missing letters for a mail bug, and complete side quests.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tinykin is a collect-a-thon like the 3D platformers of old. Gathering items and finding secrets is rewarding because every nook and cranny usually hides a discovery. Sometimes it’s bundles of pollen; other times, it’s a missing piece needed to complete a side errand, such as reuniting a photograph with its frame.&amp;nbsp;The world is a colorful, oversized jungle gym, and I’m impressed with how each room feels like a lived-in dwelling while still having clear pathways that appear organically arranged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/26/49bf611b/tinykin_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/26/b2f742e4/tinkykin_6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/26/249e77e6/tinykin_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/26/a262ce19/tinykin_4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/26/595bb9c1/tinykin_3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;I had the most fun freely exploring and using my Tinykin army to tinker with whatever lay before me, like pushing in protruding books or yanking a washing machine’s door open. Hopping across a kitchen, hallway, or bathroom is a delight from this&amp;nbsp;small perspective, and platforming feels exceptionally tight. Riding soap bars across ziplines to get around faster makes it even better, and locating shortcuts, such as climbing ropes, expedites backtracking. I only wish there was a map because the busy environments make quest givers feel like needles in a haystack whenever it’s time to turn in a job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tinykin feels comforting in an old-school sense. Its challenges never become convoluted, nor does its design reinvent the wheel, and that’s okay. Tinykin executes its handful of ideas exceptionally well, making it a thoroughly enjoyable and laid-back journey that only requires six to eight hours of your time. Don’t let this delightful adventure sneak under your radar.&lt;/p&gt;

      Everyone
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;NBA 2K23, the latest in Visual Concepts’ long-running, annualized basketball series, introduces multiple new features and revamped game mechanics while taking us on a stroll down memory lane. Though the 2K franchise has garnered a reputation for focusing more on microtransactions than actual gameplay innovation, this year’s game mode additions and foundational improvements mostly overshadow the notorious pay-to-win schemes. The result is a package that feels more novel than other titles in the series’ recent history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2K’s in-game mechanics have primarily followed a steady and successful blueprint, but this year introduces several updates, most notably the reworked shot meters and stamina bars. The new shot meter leaves little room for error, making it more challenging than previous iterations. I initially struggled with mastering this updated feature thanks to these stricter release-timing mechanics; previously, you could make a shot even if your timing wasn’t perfect, but in NBA 2K23, success almost always requires a near-perfect release.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/16/5017ee6d/nba_2k23_jordan_challenge_screenshot_3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/16/e8d603a8/nba_2k23_gameplay_screenshot_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/16/7bfa079e/nba_2k23_michael_jordan_1992_screenshot.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;The stamina system in 2K23 has also been modified and now has three adrenaline bars to go along with it. Sprinting and using explosive dribble moves now deplete the stamina and adrenaline bars. This is especially helpful in online matches as it prevents individual players from over-dribbling and encourages team play. These tweaks, though challenging to master, make the game feel as close to the actual sport as possible, which only helps the franchise in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These improvements to the core gameplay permeate the vast array of modes on offer in NBA 2K23. This suite of offerings includes all the series’ mainstays and a few exciting new ones, like the Jordan Challenge, which allows you to relive iconic moments from Michael Jordan’s career, and MyNBA Eras. The former offers fun challenges like “The Shot” and “The Flu Game,” each with its accomplishments to recreate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, instead of reliving history, MyNBA Eras enables us to rewrite it by giving us four NBA periods to choose from, each having its own varying rules and rosters. As a Suns fan, I particularly loved revisiting iconic periods, like the “7 Seconds or Less” team of the 2000s, and playing through a season in that era. This type of experience is precisely the kind of innovation the series has been missing in recent years, and its inclusion in 2K23 does wonders for rounding out this entry’s offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for the more traditional 2K modes, MyCareer remains one of the essential features of any 2K release. This year’s storyline leaves a lot to be desired, and the lack of choices makes it feel less like I’m crafting my own player’s career and more like I’m pushing through a predetermined narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the bulk of the improvements in MyCareer went into restructuring The City, the hub where you find most of your activities. Here, Visual Concepts fully embraces its RPG aspects with the retention of its quest system and the addition of The Arena, where MyCareer events are now fully integrated. The inclusion of both features gives players a fully immersive experience, and the gameday events, such as press conferences and pre-game shootarounds, make this mode feel even more like an NBA player’s career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6312434617112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players can also access the Jordan Challenge throughout the area, not to mention the multiple online competitive matches found in and around it. The four City affiliations reappear, but each of the factions’ neighborhoods has its own beautifully designed theme this time. The City’s size in 2K23 has also been reduced, and with the inclusion of fast travel using the subway system, traversing it is easier than in last year’s release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, MyTeam includes many competitive contests playable in both single- and multiplayer versions. Rather than letting you choose your starter outright, this year’s edition enables you to try out the starters first in a Triple Threat (3v3) match against A.I. before making you pick. There are also themed challenges and contests available wherein you can earn rewards to help boost your team. If you prefer the casual experience of 2K as I do, MyTeam has plenty to offer in terms of its offline, single-player modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately though, microtransactions are as present as ever in NBA 2K23. Grinding out MyTeam points and tokens is an option for those not willing to spend beyond the game’s premium price tag, but unless you’re incredibly patient, spending real money to buy packs is the easiest way to acquire a stacked squad. It’s tough this year as the currency earned through MyCareer and MyTeam matches is so minimal it takes a ridiculous amount of work to get your team and player up to par with higher-rated groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, NBA 2K23 is a fitting tribute to the historical legends and iconic moments that made this sport what it is today. Though the game has its fair share of issues with its poor narrative choices and omnipresent microtransactions, it’s still a solid improvement over the previous game. This year’s release isn’t quite the flashy free-throw line dunk that lands a perfect score, but it is a worthy, all-around effort that would earn M.J.’s shrug of approval.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The Pokémon franchise has been more prolific than usual as of late, with multiple releases over the past year and another big entry coming soon. However, those without a Switch or looking for a suitable monster-battling alternative should focus on Temtem, which has emerged from years of early-access development. While borrowing heavily from the formula of Nintendo’s massive franchise, its world is fun to explore, and collecting and learning all about the titular Temtems is satisfying. Although the core adventure is a smidge repetitive, Temtem is challenging and engaging, even for well-seasoned trainers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Temtem journey begins by selecting a partner monster and setting off to challenge the various dojos (Temtem’s version of gyms) around the Airborne Archipelago. While exploring this series of vibrant floating islands, you gain rivals, challenge dojos, and butt heads with the dastardly Clan Balsoto along the way. The pieces of a classic Pokémon experience are here for better or worse, and while that predictability bored me in the early hours, the story eventually arrives in some cool places I didn’t expect, making Temtem feel more like an "us against the world"&amp;nbsp;JRPG than a typical monster collector tends to.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/16/d4af71d4/temtem_screenshot_9.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/16/b32b5fe6/temtem_screenshot_10.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/16/b806384b/temtem_screenshot_11.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/16/6c99a4aa/temtem_screenshot_12.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/16/4a76fbc5/temtem_screenshot_13.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/16/ab9984a7/temtem_screenshot_14.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/16/1cfbd2ea/temtem16.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest draw to this genre for me is collecting as many of these cute and destructive creatures as possible. While the lack of variety and abundance of forgettable designs on the first island disappointed me, each subsequent area introduces more enticing monster designs and elemental combinations. My favorites include the deceptively cute Adoroboros and the fiery electric scarab Scaravolt. Figuring out the location of a monster I needed to fill out my Tempedia or one that would complement my current competitive team was a blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hunt for new Temtems is exciting, but I’m even higher on the battle system. These fights are strategic and challenging to the point where every tamer battle made me consider my team composition right down to the order of my squad. Contrary to the way most trainers compete in Pokémon battles, the default way to throwdown in Temtem is 2v2. It’s a twist I enjoy that deepens the strategy in just about every battle. I often had to solve battle-based puzzles, like whether my active team is the dominant duo on the board or if they’ll be quickly wiped out by well-matched opposition, with the latter case happening quite often.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6312435310112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another wrinkle I love in battle is the stamina system. Each move uses a portion of the Temtem’s stamina gauge, with lighter blows consuming far less than haymakers. However, using more stamina than what’s available takes HP, creating a high-risk, high-reward scenario for making a desperate all-out attack at the cost of your team’s health. It’s a clever solution to spamming powerful attacks, and it results in more deliberate fights, especially when going toe-to-toe with other aspiring tamers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online features flourish when I interact with others. Throughout the adventure, you see tamers running around with their partner 'Tem in tow. You can challenge them to a battle, trade, or chat about where to find a monster. An always-available rolling text chat also lets you talk with a world full of active players freely. The lack of a barrier to communicating or participating in fights and grouping up with others is refreshing for the genre and should be looked at seriously by companies like Nintendo as a feature to strive for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty to do with tamers online after the main scenario is done. On top of the competitive activities on hand, like joining a club and participating in Dojo Wars, I’ve kept busy with Temtem breeding, skimming auctions for monsters and items, and exploring the player housing neighborhoods that can be decorated with furnishings purchased all across the Archipelago. With all of the above and more to do, there’s plenty of endgame content for those who wish to stick with the game long-term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temtem may look like a copycat on its surface, but its deviations from the Pokémon formula pay off considerably. With unique battling elements and an engaging MMO structure, Temtem evolves as its own experience and offers a vast, challenging adventure that even those without a Nintendo console can enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

      Teen
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Metal: Hellsinger knows precisely what it is from the second it begins: a love letter to fast-paced first-person shooters, especially Doom, and a tribute to metal music and the culture surrounding it. It’s a no-frills shooter that asks, “What if you had to blow bodies to pieces to the beat of a metal album made by genre greats?” It excels at answering that question. It’s not perfect – the bosses are uninspired at times, and it could use an extra dash of variety in combat design – but my criticisms mattered little to my overall enjoyment of my 11-hour playthrough. What the game gets right far outshines what it doesn’t, and the developer, The Outsiders, has created what I hope is just the start of a new FPS franchise set in Hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metal is the name of the game here, literally. Music plays throughout your experience, whether it’s in the game’s fantastic campaign that takes you through realms of Hell or its trials, which unlock sigils used to strengthen your loadout during the story mode. If you like Trivium, Lamb of God, and other bands like this in the genre and guns with a fiery kick, Metal: Hellsinger is already worth the price of admission. I gunned down a massive skeletal boss to the beat of a near-operatic song backed by iconic vocals from System of a Down’s Serj Tankian. I ripped through hordes of enemy mobs and behemoth demons to the rhythm of Arch Enemy’s Alissa White-Gluz’s death-metal melodies. It was as enthralling as it sounds, in no small part, thanks to precise and punchy shooting mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/%5Bcurrent-date%3Ahtml_year%5D/%5Bcurrent-date%3Amonth%5D/%5Bcurrent-date%3Aday%5D/%5Brandom%3Ahash%3Acrc32%5D/metal_hellsinger_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/%5Bcurrent-date%3Ahtml_year%5D/%5Bcurrent-date%3Amonth%5D/%5Bcurrent-date%3Aday%5D/%5Brandom%3Ahash%3Acrc32%5D/metal_hellsinger_5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;You use one of six different weapons to attack hundreds of demons, and the game rewards you with extra damage if you fire each bullet in perfect match with the on-screen metronome that doubles as your reticle. Streaks increase your damage output and score modifier. What’s unique about this streak counter is that each new level adds a new layer to the music track. At 2x, you might hear a bass rumbling and a guitar’s subtle whine, rearing for what’s to come. At 4x, the drums might kick in. Reach 8x, and the song begins to roar, missing just the vocals, which complete the track at 16x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climbing from 2x to 16x, made easier by streak multiplier pickups littered throughout a given stage, remained as exciting the umpteenth time as it was when I first did it. It feels like bringing a song to life, like a producer, except you’re doing it with weapons that rip Hell’s demons to pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is happening because of The Unknown, the playable character in Metal: Hellsinger, banished to the deepest realms of Hell where only ice and lowly demons remain. The Unknown progresses from the iciest domains to the fieriest alongside a talking skull voiced by Troy Baker – he&amp;nbsp;brings a southern drawl that matches the game’s almost Western-like tone –&amp;nbsp;all to find and kill The Judge, a slithering ruler losing her grasp on Hell, excellently voiced by Jennifer Hale.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/%5Bcurrent-date%3Ahtml_year%5D/%5Bcurrent-date%3Amonth%5D/%5Bcurrent-date%3Aday%5D/%5Brandom%3Ahash%3Acrc32%5D/metal_hellsinger_4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/%5Bcurrent-date%3Ahtml_year%5D/%5Bcurrent-date%3Amonth%5D/%5Bcurrent-date%3Aday%5D/%5Brandom%3Ahash%3Acrc32%5D/metal_hellsinger_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/%5Bcurrent-date%3Ahtml_year%5D/%5Bcurrent-date%3Amonth%5D/%5Bcurrent-date%3Aday%5D/%5Brandom%3Ahash%3Acrc32%5D/metal_hellsinger_3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not much else to the game besides this campaign, but that’s okay because what’s there is outstanding. There are nine levels and 21 associated Torments that will test your mettle with time trials that task you with killing enemies a certain way using specific weapons and methods. There’s also an in-game codex for additional Hell-related information and extras that let you listen to the game’s tracks, but that’s it. Metal: Hellsinger is short and sweet, but it ends at exactly the right time&amp;nbsp;when it reaches the climax of both its story and its built-in metal album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have minor gripes with the game, like its Torment time trials, which either feel cheap and unfair or brilliantly designed in an almost puzzle-like way, and its boss and combat design, which could use a touch more variety, but these critiques are barely worth mentioning. My admittedly small criticisms mattered very little to how much I enjoyed playing Metal: Hellsinger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I likely won’t remember my minute frustrations with the game a few months from now, but I will remember “Dissolution,” a Two Feathers track with cathartic vocals from Bjorn “Speed” Strid of Soilwork, the realm of Hell known as Nihil, and the way my shotgun obliterated waves of enemies there. I’m so glad Metal: Hellsinger ends with the promise of more to come because I already want more from this series.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Ooblets offers a smile-inducing amalgamation of monster collecting, farming simulation, and relationship building. However, this delightful chill pill becomes tougher to swallow thanks to a tedious, grind-heavy progression that tests your patience in less enjoyable ways.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adventure whisks players to Badgetown, a quirky village where residents harmoniously live alongside Pokémon-esque creatures called Ooblets. Despite your newcomer status, the townsfolks turn to you to restore the city to its former glory. That involves tasks such as reopening buildings and cleaning up trash, all while making friends along the way. In many ways, Ooblets feels like a more purpose-driven Animal Crossing, which appealed to me as someone who prefers working towards tangible goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking off your to-do list requires the help of Ooblets. These critters serve as partners and protectors and come in many species and rarities. Though cute, some of their designs feel uninspired. For every spring-legged jellyfish, there’s an Ooblet best described as a “mushroom with a smiley face” or “a plain bird.” Instead of catching Ooblets, you must obtain their seeds, then grow one on your farm. How do you get seeds? By defeating Ooblets in dance battles, the game’s humorous spin on turn-based combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6312092134112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dance battles pit squads as large as six Ooblets against each other. Commands take the form of cards, adding an element of randomness. Many cards sport a point value, and the goal is to play enough to reach a total value, represented by a meter, before your opponent. However, you can only play a certain amount of cards each turn based on how many Beats (basically mana points) they require. You don’t build your deck; instead, you have a permanent selection of general-use cards with Ooblets bringing unique abilities, thus dictating your line-up. One Ooblet burdens the opponent’s deck with useless cards, another focuses on weakening their attack power, while others raise your card’s power by generating Hype.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the strategic elements, dance battles are a walk in the park. I never lost one in over 30 hours of playing, and it never mattered what combination of Ooblets I used since the A.I. rarely plays aggressively. I wish dance battles challenged me more because they became an uninteresting formality, especially during quests where you must complete multiple bouts in a row. However, I respect the battle system as a cute, non-violent introduction to turn-based combat for younger or inexperienced players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the bulk of the experience unfolds on your farm. In addition to growing new Ooblets, you cultivate crops by plowing land and keeping it watered. This became my favorite part of Ooblets. I enjoyed designing my farm and concocting systems to produce crops as optimally as possible (which sometimes takes days). It gets even better once you construct tools to make the job more autonomous, such as automatic sprinklers. You can also assign extra Ooblets to your farm to tend to responsibilities like pulling weeds or harvesting the ripe yield while you’re away, providing a nice incentive to obtain as many of these little helpers as possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/09/fe7dfc90/ooblets_farm_3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/09/09/a99f83d7/ooblets_rain.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/31/5a633152/ooblets_farming.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/31/edef2579/ooblets_mamoonia.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/04/b31c79f9/ooblets_dance_battle.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Farming crops and gathering materials, whether plucking them from the earth, fishing them out of the sea, or recycling them out of trash, is pivotal to Ooblet’s progression. Every major task requires players to deliver bundles of materials, whether you’re restoring Badgetown’s clubhouses, repairing a hot air balloon to travel to new cities, or fulfilling a ton of fetch quests. Having a bit of everything on you at all times matters; you can’t even challenge Ooblets to dance battles unless you’re carrying a specific crop or a dish made from them. Running into new Ooblets loses its excitement when they require a vegetable you left in storage, forcing you to trek back home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quests began to lose their appeal once I realized they’re the same, sometimes lengthy, exercise of growing or scavenging materials. This often left me at the mercy of meters and the clock, creating stretches where I meandered with few substantial options until a vital resource sprouted or replenished itself. Additionally, these progression roadblocks sometimes go overboard. One campaign mission required me to grind hundreds of precious Gummies, the game’s currency, to pay an arcade hacker. Another job repeatedly forced me to climb up and down a mountain path gated by NPCs whose requests could only be satisfied by returning home. Having some tasks rewarded with Wishies, a secondary currency spent on upgrades, helps but it’s not enough.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other elements and activities don’t entirely click either. Running a shop feels needlessly tedious since batches of items can only be sold in single quantities, making restocking a hassle. Making the rounds to chat up the same group of citizens each day to build friendship meters, which unlock decent rewards, also loses its appeal. I began to avoid the Dance Barn, which hosts dance battle tournaments to win a daily prize, due to my boredom with the combat. Locations beyond Badgetown offer little incentive to revisit them once you wrap up their campaign quests, outside of collecting missing Ooblets. Given how crucial eating food is to keep your energy up, a meter that drains throughout the day and fuels many basic actions, I was annoyed that snacks couldn’t be consumed without entering the menu, even when equipped.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ooblets offers solid fun, and I enjoy its cheerful tone. I only&amp;nbsp;wish playing it didn’t feel so much like work. Despite the pride I had in my farm, clearing checklists eventually felt more laborious than satisfying.&amp;nbsp;There’s fun to be had as long as you’re willing to work for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      Everyone 10+
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Since its debut in 2015, the Splatoon series has delivered unique, colorful gameplay cribbed by scarce launch content and disappointing time restrictions for specific modes. While post-launch content greatly bolstered both games to this point, I’ve always been disappointed by how little was initially on offer. Now on its third entry, the series may feel a bit less fresh, but Splatoon 3 remedies the series’ long-standing launch content woes while retaining all the fun that made the series such a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepping back into the stylish shoes of your custom Inkling feels great; splattering your brightly colored ink looks, feels, and sounds satisfyingly messy, particularly when you’re splatting an enemy. Few games match the smooth, intuitive mobility Splatoon gives you while submerged and cruising through a map. While Splatoon 3 provides more modes than ever, those core gameplay tenets carry over regardless of which one you play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splatoon’s competitive multiplayer, where two opposing teams battle to cover the map (and each other) with their color ink, is the destination for most, and that is where the added content feels most impactful. While maps unfortunately still operate on a timed rotation, the pool from which they are pulled is much deeper than previous launches; the 12 Turf War maps, consisting of both old and new stages, nearly match the launch total of the first two games combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6311955801112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splatoon 3 also carries forward the weapons from past games while introducing fun arsenal additions like a useful multi-target bow with rounds that explode when fully charged and the Splatana, which makes you feel like an ink-slinging ninja. Meanwhile, Splatoon 3 gives high-skill players new tools in the form of Squid Surge, a new wall-climbing burst, and Squid Roll, a shielded jump that lets you turn on a dime while swimming. Squid Surge is less valuable unless you’re climbing a tall wall, but Squid Roll, with its ability to chain together multiple moves in rapid succession, can alter the outcome of nearly any encounter if used effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like previous games, the frantic pace of these three-minute matches makes them ideal for bite-sized gaming sessions while also appealing to those who fall into a “just one more match” mindset. The final minute, where the music ramps up and everyone tries to cover as much ground as possible (literally), remains an adrenaline rush in the race to splash more ink than the opposing team. That rush amplifies in the revamped Splatfests, which now include three distinct teams. Most of the experience remains unchanged, but the new Tricolor Turf Wars, where the four-player first-place team must defend the center position against two squads of two, shake things up. These intense matches require&amp;nbsp;new strategies for everyone involved since the groups converge from opposite sides of the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the series is rightfully known for its competitive multiplayer, the other two main modes are also worthwhile components. Splatoon 3’s Salmon Run evolves the exciting wave-based cooperative PvE multiplayer experience by adding more bosses (all of whom require unique strategies to defeat) and the ability to throw the eggs you retrieve from them into the goal basket. Working together to defeat minions and retrieve enough eggs from fallen bosses to progress to the next round never ceases to excite. However, the biggest boon to this mode is that the arbitrary time restrictions from Splatoon 2 are gone in favor of the mode receiving the same 24/7 availability of the other pillars.&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;This iteration also continues the series’ tradition of providing enjoyable single-player missions that take advantage of the various mechanics of the franchise. Splatoon 3’s single-player Hero mode is a great way to familiarize yourself with the game’s controls, strategies, and weapons, but it’s far more than a glamorized tutorial. The story is inconsequential, but thanks to various gimmicks introduced at a rapid clip and puzzles involving your new companion, Smallfry, Hero mode’s levels present largely satisfying explorations of how the developers can stretch the core gameplay in surprising and exciting ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved missions like one where I grinded on rails while participating in a fast-paced shooting gallery or another where I navigated through an enemy-filled maze with a big twist at the end. While I loved almost all the time I spent in Hero Mode, there are a few misses, with some missions serving up more frustration than fun, and others veer too close to missions I played in Splatoon 2. The boss battles, which were among my favorite parts of past games, serve up a mixed bag, though they're mostly disappointing. The ones that do hit, though, are among the best the series has ever presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splatoon 3 doesn’t reinvent the wheel, nor does it need to. Instead, it improves nearly every franchise element in sometimes small but meaningful ways. With an already-robust set of content available at launch and at least two years of free and premium content on the horizon, Splatoon 3 is simultaneously the series’ best entry to date and its most promising.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Modern homages to classic video games often go one of two ways: They either stick close to the gameplay conventions to which they are paying tribute, or they expand the original games’ styles in meaningful and innovative ways. Blossom Tales II: The Minotaur Prince, like its 2017 predecessor, is more the former than the latter, adhering closely to the classic Legend of Zelda blueprint, most notably that of A Link to the Past. Despite this lack of innovation, Blossom Tales II still manages to capture many of the acclaimed elements of what many consider to be one of the greatest video games of all time, and in the process, delivers a fun, retro-facing adventure worth embarking on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After player-character Lily accidentally unleashes the Minotaur King, who swiftly kidnaps her brother, a new dark age looms unless she can put a stop to the monstrous mythological monarch. To do so, she must leave the comfort of Blossomdale to trek through pirate-infested swamplands, ghost-haunted mansions, and a monster-filled desert. I love how each biome presents different challenges and enemies to overcome, and the exploration often feels natural and intuitive, leading you from one screen to the next. I rarely felt lost during my playthrough, which is a testament to the design of the open world and the dungeons therein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6311316235112"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, despite my enjoyment of the exploration, I rarely felt adequately rewarded for poking around each nook and cranny. Treasure offered for completing even the most difficult caverns is often gold coins, of which I already had more than I could spend. On rare occasions, I received a heart piece to help me earn more health, but those were so rare (and you need four of them to add to your max health) that it was minimally exciting. Still, that didn’t stop me from bombing every cracked wall, collecting every item, and fishing every pond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blossom Tales II carries on the series’ hallmark of well-crafted dungeon experiences. Much like the world, the game’s dungeons flow well from room to room, and give you the right number of clues to progress without much frustration. While a late labyrinth is perhaps my favorite thanks to its strong mix of challenging combat and head-scratching puzzles, the dungeons feature terrific design involving minecart tracks, changing water levels, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blossom Tales II’s simple combat lacks the sophistication and smoothness of other top-down action games, but it makes up for it by giving you a wealth of items and powerups. Genre mainstays like a bow, boomerang, and bombs appear in your inventory early on, while a yo-yo that acts like a hookshot and a guitar on which you play spell-inducing songs do more than nod at the Zelda series. These items are used in interesting and satisfying ways, though I was less excited about how often I needed to pause the action and map a different item to the face buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/23/94cdbf1e/bt2-2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/23/f23c3619/bt2-4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/23/4329e679/bt2-5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/23/4b45627d/bt2-1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;The story uses an unreliable narrator convention as it’s told to children Lily and Chrys, who also serve as the two main characters of the adventure. On occasion, the kids will fight over what they want to happen, and it’s up to you to decide what to do. Though I enjoy being able to choose what kind of enemies I needed to fight or puzzle I needed to solve on occasion, the unique storytelling model is underutilized and relegated to only minor decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blossom Tales II does little to hide its Zelda inspiration from the player. While it doesn’t reach the heights of Nintendo’s legendary franchise, it does smooth over many of the early-‘90s design conventions present in games like A Link to the Past to deliver an adventure able to be enjoyed by players of all ages and experience levels. Blossom Tales II is a better game than its predecessor, and I hope we continue to get more adventures from Lily, Chrys, and their grandpa in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC
      &lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;b&gt;Publisher:&lt;/b&gt;
      EA Sports
      &lt;br /&gt;
              &lt;b&gt;Developer:&lt;/b&gt;
      EA Tiburon
      &lt;br /&gt;
              &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In Madden NFL 23, developer EA Tiburon focused on the fundamentals: authentic 11v11 football and cleaning up many of the bugs that plagued previous Madden iterations. The result is a small step forward for the franchise and a strong foundation to build on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant changes in Madden NFL 23 are under the surface. The team at EA calls it FieldSense, a shift to more physics-based interactions on the field. In practice, it’s a mostly positive change. Running the ball between bodies is chaotic and violent, true to the real-world game. There are occasional issues; would-be tacklers tend to slide off whoever is running the ball like they are coated in Teflon, for example. The way defenses wrap up opponents and how ball carriers fight for extra yards feels authentic, but the high frequency of fumbles on these plays needs adjustment. It’s imperfect but a solid first implementation of a system that should improve in future iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/22/d3ec0018/pancake_block.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/22/4ef9c089/touchdown.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/22/da7c9a6c/gang_tackle.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/22/578f015b/john_madden.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/22/a6c04d68/madden_nfl_23_20220821193827.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/22/a7d44d30/madden_nfl_23_20220821194136.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/08/22/bb53e030/madden_nfl_23_20220821194654.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;The overall presentation is a noticeable step forward. From boot up, everything is awash with the legacy of the late John Madden – a fitting tribute to the man behind the name. Updated scans of equipment and players look excellent, and the gameday presentation features more vibrant graphical overlays and cinematic camera work that feel more like an NFL broadcast. The authenticity is appealing; I skipped fewer transitions during games to enjoy the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The much-ballyhooed Skill-Based Passing adds an interesting (and optional) wrinkle to throwing the football. Having a target area and aiming reticle takes a bit of getting used to, but the additional control over ball location does make a difference, especially for avoiding defenders while throwing over the middle of the field. It quickly became second nature, and I sorely missed the fine aiming controls when I went back to play a game in Madden 22. The passing meter, on the other hand, is a non-factor. Generally, my muscle memory for how long to hold a pass button lined up with perfect passes and turning the feature off or on didn’t make a noticeable impact on the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connected Franchise evolved in Madden 22 with an updated scouting system and an overhauled interface. This year it’s more of a refinement. The addition of Motivations and Tags adds a nice sense of humanity to the players in the league. Motivations include the desire to play with a franchise quarterback or in a fair-weather stadium. If you have what a free agent is looking for, you may be able to attract them with a team-friendly deal. Otherwise, you may need to overpay to land your man. I worry how that will play out in competitive leagues; it won’t be clear if it creates a significant imbalance immediately, but the potential is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qv6G_w8RUOo" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tags are rarer and reflect a player's role and how they affect the team's dynamic as a whole. A player with a Mentor tag may not be the best on the field, but they'll accelerate the development of younger players at their position. It’s the sort of off-the-field factor that NFL GMs consider, and I enjoyed the added element when I constructed my team. When I drafted a star safety, I was immediately motivated to seek out a veteran for them to learn from, in a fun bit of roleplaying that Connected Franchise often lacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Face of the Franchise remains a mixed result. Playing exclusively as a quarterback, running back, or linebacker can be fun, as you are involved in every play. This year, corner, a new position for Face of the Franchise, is a worse experience. I went entire drives without having any impact on the game, and it was frustrating to miss out on goals for tackles or stopping drives because of things outside of my control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Madden NFL series has long had a solid gameplay foundation, maintained by small improvements year over year. Madden NFL 23 is the first iteration in a long time that rebuilds that foundation, and that’s where this year's greatest success lies. Some slippery collisions aside, the more physics-based action is a good change, and the control over ball placement from Skill-Based passing is a welcome addition. This comes at the cost of only minor updates to the core gameplay modes, but it was ultimately the right call to make, and Madden is a better game for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The Saints Row reboot features a new cast of characters and a different location to explore, but its heart and soul haven’t changed: Players can once again expect an exciting crime fest, giggle-worthy humor, purple splattered everywhere, and an open-world chock full of things to do and secrets to unearth. The game also has a knack for blowing everything up. In other words, it is great fun in that traditional Saints Row way and even better when experienced with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saints Row establishes an exciting pulse from the outset of play that periodically palpitates with graphical glitches or can outright flatline when gameplay bugs halt progress. The rough edges are noticeable yet are minor nuisances in an otherwise outstanding game. Saints Row has never been better, but I wouldn’t call it the next evolution in the series – it feels like an alternate sequel to Saints Row 3. Take that as both a compliment and a minor complaint. The mission designs and co-op play creatively build off that formula, while the gunplay and animations haven’t shown much improvement and are well behind what we expect in games today.&lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/07/20/1716d657/saints4.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;This entry hits with silliness within minutes of play, with the lead character delivering what is likely the longest string of f-bombs in all of entertainment. This moment cements the game’s silly (and low brow) vibe, which hits more than it misses, and shows the protagonist can be a bit of a wild card. The player designs this character, determining their sex, voice, facial features, and even the size of their genitalia. This lead is nicely penned and blends seamlessly with a fantastic supporting cast that gives the game a legitimate team dynamic, both in the story and mission flow. Eli is the brains of the operation, and his love of LARPing rubs off on you. Neenah’s obsession with cars and art is contagious and represented in play. And then there’s Kev, who is always shirtless, loves tacos, and is one of the fathers to a fantastic cat (that actually plays a significant role in the plot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fictional world of Santa Ileso is just as colorful as this cast, stealing the eye with creative architectural designs like dinosaur statues and state-of-the-art skyscrapers backed by scenic deserts and mountains. I like how developer Deep Silver Volition encourages the player to stop to admire the architectural craftsmanship with photo opportunities. When photographed, some of these wonders transform into decorations for the Saints’ base. I don’t know how many hours I sunk trying to track these collectibles down. They reward you well for taking the time to explore.&lt;/p&gt;














	


  
    

  
      
            &lt;img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/07/20/3594d8ba/saints12.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;


      
  










&lt;p&gt;Getting around Santa Ileso is rarely a bore, even if stretches of it are remarkably flat. From hoverbikes to battery-powered tanks, vehicle variety is high and surprisingly powerful. A basic rusted-out car doubles as a weapon that can knock other vehicles off the road and break the laws of physics to turn corners on a dime. Most of these rides offer extensive tuner customization, allowing their looks to transform through deep wells of body mod parts, tires, paint, and more. Additional customization parts are tucked off to the side as hidden collectibles, giving yet another reason to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed every mission in the game. The critical path and side hustles are handled with care, delivering interesting or goofy objectives in locations that collectively give you a good look at most of the map’s significant landscapes and interiors. It wouldn’t be fair of me to spoil these setups, but I was particularly impressed by a prison mission that turns into a music video for Onyx’s “Slam.” These missions scale nicely for cooperative play, as do the mostly optional criminal ventures. Insurance Fraud sadly hasn’t evolved (yet is still dumb fun), but there’s a nice variety to them collectively. Most are short and sweet, and reward the player with much-needed new skills, cash, weapon crafting materials, and maybe even a new car or outfit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6278171090001"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New ventures unlock at a nice pace since they are tied to critical beats in the story, delivering something different to dive into even at the game’s end. The story progresses at a decent clip until around the third act, where it feels like an entire chapter of the game is missing. The Saints go from rags to riches in the blink of an eye, and the final act unfolds. It’s a jarring plot skip that delivers the sensation that I missed a big chunk of the Saints’ growth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Combat is one of the biggest parts of the game, and it never truly finds its groove. Part of the problem is I felt bad for most of my opponents. They either charge haphazardly into most battles, getting riddled with each step, or perform an awkward dive roll, which leaves them vulnerable as they consider what to do next. The selection of firearms also disappoints both in feel and variety. The oddly named Thrustbuster is Saints Row’s greatest weapon to date (as it sends enemies into the stratosphere), but most machineguns and pistols feel unremarkable. The default lock-on targeting system strips excitement from the firefights and is something most games abandoned generations ago. All that said, blowing stuff up – which you do all the time – is incredibly rewarding given just how extensive most damage is. The rockets and grenades help give the combat system a pulse.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/07/20/096e6a85/saints1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/07/20/5d1525f1/saints2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/07/20/9f64d8bd/saints3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/07/20/1fd24b7a/saints5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;In my 30 hours of play, I experienced several glitches, the most severe being my weapons no longer firing, but most were of the visual variety, like my character’s head disappearing. The gameplay can be rough and may force you to reload a checkpoint. Thankfully, the game is liberal with them, so too much time isn’t lost, but it still stinks to have to repeat steps. Here’s hoping the game receives additional polish post-launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may not push your new hardware to the limit and is a little rough around the edges, but the latest Saints Row is everything it needs to be, delivering a wonderful comedic experience with plenty of depth. While a little irritating, I was never bored and wanted to see where my team’s goofy antics would take them next. The payoffs are often worth the time investment, and just veering off the beaten path pays dividends. I’m glad the Saints are back, hopefully for another long haul.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The group of bounty hunters gathers in their favorite bar once more. For the first time, protagonist Ringo pays attention to the lush cherry blossom decoration over the rooftop. Her friends say the real ones are even more beautiful and laugh at the idea of a bunch of Devil Summoners having a picnic and watching the flowers. The friendly mockery leads to a funny yet endearing message: “I think we oughta show Ringo the fun side of being human, don’t you?” Sadly, Soul Hackers 2 doesn’t seem to agree with the sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soul Hackers 2 is the sequel to 1997’s Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers, an RPG spun from the Shin Megami Tensei series. 25 years later, after games like Persona 5 put the SMT universe in the spotlight, the landscape couldn’t be more different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in the 21st century, two clans of Devil Summoners fight for an ancient power. As a result, Aion, a highly developed artificial intelligence far closer to reality than I’m comfortable with, predicts that doomsday is forthcoming. The only ones capable of preventing it are Ringo and Figue, two personifications of Aion in the flesh. Both can hack people’s souls to bring them back to life and give them a second chance while serving as key pieces to prevent doom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise is interesting, and although the villains don't carry enough weight to stand out, I was invested in the story. Naturally, the pasts of the three characters joining Ringo on her quest intertwine with the larger narrative. There are glimpses about the meaning of mortality around Ringo’s gift, as well as how the soul-hacked choose to act when allowed to settle a long-standing score or recover a bond with a partner. But the most interesting plot points feel rushed without enough room to create meaningful stakes or emotional tolls. As a result, the few moments that stand out feel unearned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gameplaywise, Soul Hackers 2 doesn’t offer an incentive to stray off the main path and spend more time in its otherwise interesting world. Side quests are unremarkable and based around revisiting areas that aren’t interesting to explore. The combat is more on par with Persona 5 than Shin Megami Tensei V, offering many upgrades and skills to tailor your experience. Only that it’s far more streamlined, lacking the enticing press-turn mechanic from the mainline games that add turns when you exploit an enemy’s weakness. Instead, doing so adds a stack to the Sabbath, which acts as an all-out-attack at the end of your turn. It makes for a pretty spectacle as the arena is slowly engulfed in a colorful aura the more attacks you can stack. But it also makes for unnecessarily long encounters without much risk. Enemies can’t exploit your party’s weaknesses, either, so you can always just heal up afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 30 hours it took to hit credits, I kept trying to latch onto the elements that work. Soul Hackers 2’s saving grace lies in its main characters, each with a distinct personality that often clashes with the rest. Witnessing the group’s growth by putting their differences aside and opening themselves up to camaraderie was a joy. I loved their conversations about freelancing as Devil Summoners as much as the tough chats about the people they lost over a meal or a drink. But there’s not a seat on the table for the player to take it all in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that night at the bar, the group wondered if they’d still be alive by the time the flowers bloomed again. And I know that they will because I put in the effort to make that happen. I just wish I was rewarded with a bit more humanity and meaning to my struggles by seeing them create that memory for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
