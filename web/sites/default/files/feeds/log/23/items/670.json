An old Polaroid-style camera. Discovering how means braving Madison, an indie horror title that fits within the post-P.T. first-person haunted house mold. Players explore an impressively rendered home solving puzzles and avoiding apparitions armed with a camera that\u2019s more than meets the eye. Despite having a strong premise, presentation, and core mechanic, the experience gets bogged down by flawed puzzle design and repetitive scares.<\/p>\n\n<p>As Luca, a demon has manipulated you into completing a dark ritual within your haunted family home. Along the way, you\u2019ll learn of Madison Hale, a practitioner of witchcraft who committed a series of grisly ritualistic murders before being killed herself. While she sits at the center of your plight, the story also weaves in your family\u2019s history with the demonic in ways that sometimes feel disconnected to the main plot, making it unclear how, say, a supernatural trip to a 1950s church directly relates to present events. Luca\u2019s panicked, eye-rolling ramblings also became a distraction, so I\u2019m thankful a Silent Mode let me turn him into a muted, subtitled protagonist to raise the creepy factor.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your supernatural camera serves as your primary interactive tool and occasional weapon. Photographing key locations can shatter barriers, open portals to new areas, and cause other cool, reality-bending effects. The photos themselves often serve as crucial clues. It\u2019s a neat mechanic, and I like the tension of shaking a Polaroid to see what big revelation appears. Since there\u2019s no visual indication of when to take a photograph, I learned to snap a picture of something whenever I hit a wall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2021\/07\/08\/516abd8a\/madison_screen_3.jpg\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" alt=\"\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" \/>\n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When the camera isn\u2019t the answer, you\u2019ll be rummaging through a limited inventory of items for the right tool to pry open floorboards or snap chains. Puzzle-solving evokes Resident Evil in that sense, and while there are some clever riddles, others can be too opaque, and it can be easy to lose the thread on what to do next.<\/p>\n\n<p>After receiving a new item, I wandered the house for over an hour looking for a way to use it, only to learn I had to return to a room I\u2019d thoroughly explored to find an unrelated item that had appeared in the corner of the floor. A notebook that conveys your next objective threw in a vaguer waypoint; the solution required such a giant leap in logic that I yelled, \u201cHow would I know that?!\u201d These situations occur more than I would have liked, so don\u2019t be afraid to keep a walkthrough open because re-running the house multiple times to find a metaphorical needle in a haystack nullifies the sense of dread.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Exploring this cursed dwelling during the opening hour or two raised hairs thanks to its oppressive atmosphere and exceptional lighting work. A shadow-covered corner or stairway always gave me pause, and the game\u2019s ambient bumps and camera tricks had me second-guessing each step. Unfortunately, the longer I explored, the more I noticed Madison\u2019s excessive use of its looping soundboard of creaks, moans, and thunderclaps. I eventually stopped jumping at the same door-closing sound effect because I knew it wasn\u2019t threatening, and it made Madison\u2019s home feel closer to a county fair haunted house with a broken record player.<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/07\/14\/1120bb04\/madison_3.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/07\/14\/edba1cf9\/madison_5.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/07\/14\/0e31ee9d\/madison_4.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2021\/07\/08\/3232265b\/madison_screen_1.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          \u00a0\n\n<p>That isn\u2019t to say that Madison doesn\u2019t have terrifying moments; activating a series of record players while being stalked by a demonic creature from a children\u2019s book freaked me out, and the game features its fair share of \u201cnope\u201d moments.
