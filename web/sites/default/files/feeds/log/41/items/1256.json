There are plenty of challenges on campus that require a strategic mind to overcome. Every student has specific traits and personalities, and they\u2019ll drop out if you don\u2019t satisfy their needs. The only way to reach the campus ratings you need to succeed is to develop an environment ripe for education, which includes managing systems like hygiene, hunger, entertainment, social interaction, campus attractiveness, and in some cases, external factors like extreme temperatures.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/08\/03\/240b68c3\/knight_school_4.png\" alt=\"two point campus review\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" \/>\n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Some students might be great at studying but lower your school\u2019s rating with poor hygiene if you don\u2019t install ample shower rooms and bathrooms. Others might drop the campus\u2019 average grade but can become relatively low-maintenance tenants with a tutoring course or more stimulation via a music concert or jousting tournament. The same principle applies to faculty. Highly skilled staff come at a price, namely a salary, but they\u2019ll also need on-site comforts like break rooms to blow off steam.

All these programs require money, and there\u2019s only so much room in the budget. If you\u2019re flippant with renovation approvals, you\u2019ll be out of funds quickly, especially at campuses with a high-maintenance student body. In the case of an empty wallet, you can borrow loans, but it\u2019s easy to get into hot water fast with interest payments. This balancing act is sometimes frustrating but is an effective gameplay loop and is one of the main reasons I love playing Two Point Campus. If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, you can change the game\u2019s speed or outright pause, giving you time to solve problems or simply focus on designing without the pressure of the in-game calendar.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/08\/03\/d48b6b39\/7.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/08\/03\/2e184b35\/9.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/08\/03\/8801beab\/gig.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/08\/03\/da69700e\/wizardry_2.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          \u00a0\n\n<p>Two Point Campus features robust creation tools, allowing me to design most things to my desired specifications \u2013 inside and outside.
