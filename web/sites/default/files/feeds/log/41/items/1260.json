The animation throughout is fantastic, feeling believable to the minute movements cats make \u2013 so much so that my dog growled at my computer when I first started playing. Stray constantly finds new opportunities to play with its character \u2013 in both significant and minor ways, like pushing things off tables and scratching at doors \u2013 and I had a lot of fun discovering these unique interactions while exploring the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2021\/07\/27\/f30cb7ec\/stray_boat.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/prod-media.gameinformer.com\/styles\/body_default\/s3\/2020\/06\/12\/143e3ba4\/stray5.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/prod-media.gameinformer.com\/styles\/body_default\/s3\/2020\/06\/12\/957123ed\/stray4.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/prod-media.gameinformer.com\/styles\/body_default\/s3\/2020\/06\/12\/b379e54b\/stray3.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/prod-media.gameinformer.com\/styles\/body_default\/s3\/2020\/06\/12\/818dcbde\/stray1.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/prod-media.gameinformer.com\/styles\/body_default\/s3\/2020\/06\/12\/55469480\/stray2.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          &nbsp;\n\n<p>Inspired by Hong Kong's now-demolished real-life Kowloon Walled City \u2013 notable for its strikingly dense architecture and population \u2013 Stray's world is artistically fantastic.

I enjoyed the occasional dips into combat, stealth, and evasion far less as they never did much interesting with the cat.
