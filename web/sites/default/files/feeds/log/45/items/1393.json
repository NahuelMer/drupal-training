From boot up, everything is awash with the legacy of the late John Madden \u2013 a fitting tribute to the man behind the name. Updated scans of equipment and players look excellent, and the gameday presentation features more vibrant graphical overlays and cinematic camera work that feel more like an NFL broadcast. The authenticity is appealing; I skipped fewer transitions during games to enjoy the presentation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The much-ballyhooed Skill-Based Passing adds an interesting (and optional) wrinkle to throwing the football. Having a target area and aiming reticle takes a bit of getting used to, but the additional control over ball location does make a difference, especially for avoiding defenders while throwing over the middle of the field. It quickly became second nature, and I sorely missed the fine aiming controls when I went back to play a game in Madden 22. The passing meter, on the other hand, is a non-factor. Generally, my muscle memory for how long to hold a pass button lined up with perfect passes and turning the feature off or on didn\u2019t make a noticeable impact on the field.<\/p>\n\n<p>Connected Franchise evolved in Madden 22 with an updated scouting system and an overhauled interface. This year it\u2019s more of a refinement. The addition of Motivations and Tags adds a nice sense of humanity to the players in the league. Motivations include the desire to play with a franchise quarterback or in a fair-weather stadium. If you have what a free agent is looking for, you may be able to attract them with a team-friendly deal. Otherwise, you may need to overpay to land your man. I worry how that will play out in competitive leagues; it won\u2019t be clear if it creates a significant imbalance immediately, but the potential is there.<\/p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Qv6G_w8RUOo\" width=\"\"><\/iframe>\n\n<p>Tags are rarer and reflect a player's role and how they affect the team's dynamic as a whole. A player with a Mentor tag may not be the best on the field, but they'll accelerate the development of younger players at their position. It\u2019s the sort of off-the-field factor that NFL GMs consider, and I enjoyed the added element when I constructed my team. When I drafted a star safety, I was immediately motivated to seek out a veteran for them to learn from, in a fun bit of roleplaying that Connected Franchise often lacks.<\/p>\n\n<p>Face of the Franchise remains a mixed result. Playing exclusively as a quarterback, running back, or linebacker can be fun, as you are involved in every play. This year, corner, a new position for Face of the Franchise, is a worse experience.

Madden NFL 23 is the first iteration in a long time that rebuilds that foundation, and that\u2019s where this year's greatest success lies. Some slippery collisions aside, the more physics-based action is a good change, and the control over ball placement from Skill-Based passing is a welcome addition. This comes at the cost of only minor updates to the core gameplay modes, but it was ultimately the right call to make, and Madden is a better game for it.<\/p>\n  \n\n    <h2>Score:\n    7.5<\/h2>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/scoring\" target=\"_blank\">About Game Informer's review system<\/a>\n  <\/p>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamestop.com\/search\/?q=Madden%20NFL%2023\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button\">Purchase<\/a>","description":"\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n\n\n\n      <p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/08\/22\/3e21e989\/madden_nfl_23_20220821194753.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Madden NFL 23\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" \/><\/p>\n\n  <p>\n              <b>Reviewed on:<\/b>\n      PlayStation 5\n      <br \/>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <b>Platform:<\/b>\n      PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X\/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC\n      <br \/>\n                  <b>Publisher:<\/b>\n      EA Sports\n      <br \/>\n              <b>Developer:<\/b>\n      EA Tiburon\n      <br \/>\n              <\/p>\n\n      <p>In Madden NFL 23, developer EA Tiburon focused on the fundamentals: authentic 11v11 football and cleaning up many of the bugs that plagued previous Madden iterations.
