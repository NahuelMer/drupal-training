That game\u2019s focus on story, characters, and its expanded social systems helped make it the best-selling in the series, creating new fans of the franchise out of those who had previously watched Fire Emblem flourish from a distance. I was one of those new converts three years ago, and while I was initially concerned if I was a Fire Emblem fan or just a Three Houses fan, Engage has solidified me in the former. Where Three Houses succeeded by emphasizing its larger-than-life heroes and social systems over combat, Engage triumphs in doing the opposite. Engage is a combat-first, everything-else-second strategy RPG, and although its story takes some time to become engrossing, battles are terrific from the jump and only get better.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Engage\u2019s story begins in a familiar way: A hero saves the world from the Fell Dragon, an evil divinity, and goes into a slumber afterward. They awake 1,000 years later only to discover their battlefield prowess is needed once more. This hero, your protagonist known as the Divine Dragon, must obtain all 12 Engage rings held by neighboring kingdoms. I was never bored by this narrative, but it was simple and often predictable for a large portion of my 50-hour playthrough. The last third of the game\u2019s story further reeled me in with twists, turns, drama, and heart, though, and by the end of my playthrough, I laughed that I had written the story off initially.<\/p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/DMGCtrfbZQc\" width=\"\"><\/iframe>\n\n<p>Still, Engage is more straightforward; it\u2019s a traditional fantasy story about saving the day, and while at times it\u2019s melodramatic, I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t all-in on it, especially in the last third. Power Ranger-esque team-up moments left me smiling like a kid again, and I was sad to say goodbye to these characters when the credits began to roll.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Engage\u2019s combat is a return to form for the Fire Emblem series, bringing back the traditional rock-paper-scissors formula where lances beat swords, swords beat axes, and axes beat lances, while fisticuff fighters have an advantage over archers, mages, and thieves. It\u2019s a simple fighting premise that works because it forces you to examine unit placement, movement, and strategy well in advance based on enemy positioning on a given map. And this formula is strengthened by a game that builds on the combat in virtually every sense; most everything you do ties back to what happens in battle, including the game\u2019s namesake, Engage.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Each unit can wear an Emblem Ring, which gives them the ability to Engage or tap into that ring\u2019s power fueled by the soul of a hero from Fire Emblem\u2019s past. This brings series favorites like Marth, Lucina, Roy, Byleth, and more to the game, and while they aren\u2019t the same person as the hero from their original world, they embody them, bringing a heaping dose of nostalgia to Engage for longtime fans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/f496e0fe\/fire_emblem_engage1.jpg\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" alt=\"\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" \/>\n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For newer fans who might not realize the excitement behind these returns, the Engage mechanic is still a battlefield boon as it allows the wearer to physically change in appearance, almost embodying the past hero, to become significantly more powerful. When you Engage a unit, they get a special one-time move that usually does extreme damage (or healing), standard attacks are more devastating, some units can move even further, and their ability to dodge or withstand enemy attacks is strengthened.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Engage mechanic felt overly powerful in the first half, but was still exciting to use nonetheless. The second half, however, is a stern reminder that strategy is still required in nearly every battle, including the Paralogue side quests, which is where Intelligent Systems really stretches its combat design prowess with challenging map layouts and matchups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/04\/24720e7c\/engage_2.jpg\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" alt=\"\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" \/>\n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Social systems between units take a backseat to social standings with Emblem Ring heroes mechanically, but strangely, support conversations between units and\u00a0heroes are short and shallow compared to those that happen between two unit members. Regardless, these conversations serve as small windows into a hero or unit member's personality, unlocked after ranking up to C, B, or A with someone. Like in previous entries, these support conversations aren't a requirement in Engage but are additional flavor for the game's various characters.<\/p>\n\n<p>As the bond level between a unit and an Emblem Ring hero increases, so do the skills available to purchase. These skills and abilities, like increased luck or avoid, can be equipped for use even when not wearing a given ring. My Divine Dragon can, for example, equip traits from Marth\u2019s ring even if he\u2019s wearing an Emblem Ring of another hero. And even units that you never equip with an Emblem Ring can tap into these skills and abilities thanks to special Emblem bond training.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Bond rings created by Emblem Ring heroes further expand the possibilities of combat-focused customization. You can create hundreds of bond rings, meld them to strengthen them further, polish Emblem Rings to increase bonds, and so much more. Engage\u2019s various ring mechanics power much of what you\u2019re doing in the game, but it\u2019s also mostly optional. If you want to play it straight, it feels like you can do that in Engage, but if you\u2019re looking for deep customization and optimization, that\u2019s there too, and I appreciate that flexibility.<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/79f676b6\/fire_emblem_engage6.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/cc7fa300\/fire_emblem_engage7.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/e616951e\/fire_emblem_engage11.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/4a184d7c\/fire_emblem_engage12.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/60ac255a\/fire_emblem_engage15.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/f171d965\/fire_emblem_engage4.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          \u00a0\n\n<p>Ring creation happens at The Somniel, which is Engage\u2019s open hub where virtually everything outside of combat, like cooking, shopping, and more, occurs. It\u2019s also home to exercise minigames that temporarily boost a given stat in the next battle and a Wyvern riding minigame that earns you additional bond fragments. You can train in the Arena, fish, collect ingredients in the orchard, and explore this hub to find items. The Somniel is expansive enough but, in most ways, a step back to Three Houses\u2019 monastery, which felt like a crucial pitstop in between every combat encounter and a place I came to know like the back of my hand. The Somniel never quite felt like home, but rather a place to strengthen my party for the next battle. Given the game\u2019s focus on combat, though, this wasn\u2019t surprising. Still, I was slightly disappointed it didn\u2019t have more personality.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/2cbaec3c\/fire_emblem_engage9.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/a5a8118b\/fire_emblem_engage10.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          \u00a0\n\n<p>The Somniel is also home to the multiplayer-focused Tower of Trials, which is where you can build maps, connect them to other players\u2019 maps, and duke it out in Outrealm Trials. While this is neat in practice, Engage gives you the same square base to build on, and every map felt similar as a result, with the biggest differences coming from where I placed a fire cannon or something like destructible crystals. Every map I played on, including the ones I created, lacked the excitement, variance, and challenge of the developer-made maps in the single-player campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/20c8840b\/fire_emblem_engage14.jpg\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" alt=\"\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" \/>\n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s also the Tempest Trial, which has you fighting across multiple battles in one go for increased rewards, and the Relay Trial, which sees multiple players controlling the same units in a relay-style battle. But neither these nor the Outrealm Trials are things I see myself returning to post-game. They\u2019re interesting additions but feel half-baked, only there for those who desperately need more after the core game\u2019s dozens of combat encounters.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Engage\u2019s characters and social systems never quite hit the high bar set by Three Houses, but it does surpass its predecessor in almost every other way. Players looking for deep customization, expertly crafted strategy RPG combat, and a heartfelt story with adoration for more than 30 years of Fire Emblem history will find that and more in Engage. It\u2019s one of the most gripping games I\u2019ve played on Switch and, ultimately, one I struggled to peel myself away from. If Three Houses was an experiment with where Fire Emblem\u2019s social mechanics can go, then Engage is doing the same for the series\u2019 evolving combat, and excelling just as much, too.<\/p>\n  \n\n      <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/scoring\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"gi-must-play\" src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/2022\/02\/24\/fb77bb22\/mustplay_badge_rgb_tiny.jpg\" height=\"50\" width=\"39\" alt=\"GI Must Play\" \/><\/a>\n    <h2>Score:\n    9<\/h2>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/scoring\" target=\"_blank\">About Game Informer's review system<\/a>\n  <\/p>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamestop.com\/search\/?q=Fire%20Emblem%20Engage\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button\">Purchase<\/a>","description":"\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n\n\n\n      <p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/f85e9e9c\/fire_emblem_engage8.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Fire Emblem Engage review game informer\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" \/><\/p>\n\n  <p>\n              <b>Reviewed on:<\/b>\n      Switch\n      <br \/>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <b>Platform:<\/b>\n      Switch\n      <br \/>\n                  <b>Publisher:<\/b>\n      Nintendo\n      <br \/>\n                  <\/p>\n\n      <p>Fire Emblem Engage is the mainline follow-up, in name only, to 2019\u2019s excellent Fire Emblem Three Houses.

Still, I was slightly disappointed it didn\u2019t have more personality.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/2cbaec3c\/fire_emblem_engage9.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/a5a8118b\/fire_emblem_engage10.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          \u00a0\n\n<p>The Somniel is also home to the multiplayer-focused Tower of Trials, which is where you can build maps, connect them to other players\u2019 maps, and duke it out in Outrealm Trials. While this is neat in practice, Engage gives you the same square base to build on, and every map felt similar as a result, with the biggest differences coming from where I placed a fire cannon or something like destructible crystals. Every map I played on, including the ones I created, lacked the excitement, variance, and challenge of the developer-made maps in the single-player campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2023\/01\/16\/20c8840b\/fire_emblem_engage14.jpg\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" alt=\"\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" \/>\n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s also the Tempest Trial, which has you fighting across multiple battles in one go for increased rewards, and the Relay Trial, which sees multiple players controlling the same units in a relay-style battle. But neither these nor the Outrealm Trials are things I see myself returning to post-game. They\u2019re interesting additions but feel half-baked, only there for those who desperately need more after the core game\u2019s dozens of combat encounters.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Engage\u2019s characters and social systems never quite hit the high bar set by Three Houses, but it does surpass its predecessor in almost every other way. Players looking for deep customization, expertly crafted strategy RPG combat, and a heartfelt story with adoration for more than 30 years of Fire Emblem history will find that and more in Engage. It\u2019s one of the most gripping games I\u2019ve played on Switch and, ultimately, one I struggled to peel myself away from. If Three Houses was an experiment with where Fire Emblem\u2019s social mechanics can go, then Engage is doing the same for the series\u2019 evolving combat, and excelling just as much, too.<\/p>\n  \n\n      <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/scoring\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"gi-must-play\" src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/2022\/02\/24\/fb77bb22\/mustplay_badge_rgb_tiny.jpg\" height=\"50\" width=\"39\" alt=\"GI Must Play\" \/><\/a>\n    <h2>Score:\n    9<\/h2>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/scoring\" target=\"_blank\">About Game Informer's review system<\/a>\n  <\/p>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamestop.com\/search\/?q=Fire%20Emblem%20Engage\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button\">Purchase<\/a>","author_name":"Wesley LeBlanc","timestamp":1673964000,"updated":1673964000,"url":"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/review\/fire-emblem-engage\/propelling-to-the-future-using-the-past","guid":"119789","tags":[],"geolocations":null,"enclosures":null,"feed_title":"Game Informer Reviews","feed_description":"From the biggest triple-A releases to cult indie hits, Game Informer reviews identify which games are worth your time.","feed_url":"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/","author_email":""}
