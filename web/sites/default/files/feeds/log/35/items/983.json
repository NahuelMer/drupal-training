These weapons, voiced by Roiland and comedians including JB Smoove\u00a0and Tim Robinson, talk your ears off to the point of annoyance, with your primary gun, Kenny, being the biggest culprit. Sometimes their banter doesn\u2019t even make sense, such as a gun complaining about not being used in ages when I\u2019d used them seconds ago.

The humor isn\u2019t so much about setting up clever punchlines as it is about reiterating the same basic gag with a barrage of expletives until it, hopefully, becomes funny. It usually doesn\u2019t. What\u2019s more, everyone feels like slight variations of the same crass caricature, whether it's your irresponsible older sister or freeloading bounty-hunting mentor. The game pokes fun at everything, including making fourth-wall-breaking wisecracks about game design and the industry in general. However, it also does little to freshen up the tropes it lampoons. Ripping on a pipe puzzle for being by-the-books without doing anything unique itself makes the joke feel hollow and hypocritical.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Though it never had me in stitches, High on Life has a few humorous bits. I smiled at the aggressive banter of a family of loud-mouthed construction workers, and a head-turning reference to a popular restaurant chain offers a fun visual gag. Obtaining special discs that summon small diorama-like areas that serve as large, singular jokes garner some of the better laughs, as do a sprinkling of unexpected celebrity cameos.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>High on Life\u2019s humor whiffs more than it hits, and the gameplay isn\u2019t far behind. The shooting feels passable enough to offer mindless fun, but it\u2019s not great. Melee executions evoke Doom\u2019s glory kills without the\u00a0satisfying snappiness. The limited arsenal of living weapons have primary and alternative firing modes. Kenny, for example, fires standard pistol rounds and can unleash mortar-like goop balls that launch groups of targets airborne to juggle with bullets. My favorite weapon is Gus, a shotgun that fires a large disc that ricochets off enemies. In a neat twist, you can strike this disc to extend its momentum.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/12\/15\/05c7e5f2\/high_on_life_1.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/12\/15\/bcfd8bc9\/high_on_life_2.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/12\/15\/ab60869a\/high_on_life_4.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/12\/13\/515ef13c\/oldtown_high_on_life.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/12\/13\/d0551be0\/gus_high_on_life.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          \u00a0\n\n<p>Combat begins as a drag but picks up as you acquire more guns, and I enjoy combining their talents.
