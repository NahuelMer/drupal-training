Previous outings Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunting Grounds pit Jason and Predator against camp counselors and mercenaries with flashes of greatness, but technical issues and uneven design choices held them back. With Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, the team has applied everything it\u2019s learned about compelling asymmetrical multiplayer to a property that perfectly lines up with the game style.<\/p>\n\n<p>Four fully-customizable Ghostbusters face off against one ghost on five maps ranging from an Alcatraz-inspired prison to a cozy lodge. The key difference from other asymmetrical games is both sides are fun to play. You\u2019re not just biding time until you can play as the ghost. If that\u2019s all you want to do, however, it\u2019s easy to set your preference and be haunting random players online with hardly any wait time (at least during my tests on launch day). The active early player base and full crossplay between all platforms combine to make this happen, and it\u2019s impressive to see such smooth execution out of the gate. If you\u2019re a Ghostbusters fan who doesn\u2019t like online multiplayer, it\u2019s easy to play against not-so-challenging bots and still experience all the content.<\/p>\n\n<p>The match flow starts with Busters fanning out with P.K.E. meters drawn to track down the ghost and its respawn points. These rifts are hidden within objects, and destroying them takes away one of the ghost\u2019s three \u201clives.\u201d If you encounter the ghost directly, you can zap it with your Proton Pack and wrangle it into a trap to eat up a life as well. On the ghost side, you try to haunt as many objects as possible and scare the NPC civilians wandering around to increase the overall haunting level of the map. Once haunting reaches 100 percent or the ghost runs out of rifts, a final endgame timer begins. If the Busters capture the ghost in that time, they win. The map is officially haunted if the ghost evades capture, and the Busters scurry away in shame.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/21\/d7a835d2\/lodge_-_buster_nohud_-_025.png\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" alt=\"\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" \/>\n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Calling to your buds when you spot the ghost and cramming it into a trap as a team is extremely satisfying. While the Busters can be temporarily incapacitated with slime, no one is ever stuck on the sidelines watching the rest of the match play out. There\u2019s always hunting or blasting to do. The only low point on the Buster side is calming NPCs with the same VO lines ad nauseam.<\/p>\n\n<p>The five ghost types account for a variety of play styles. Do you want to be quick and mischievous, go on the offensive with God of War-style chain attacks, or use tricks to manipulate and misdirect? All ghosts have a basic attack, a minion summon (for occupying Busters or frightening civilians), an ultimate move with a long cooldown, and a unique action that\u2019s different for every skin. Possessing objects is key to hiding from Busters and recharging the energy you need to do pretty much anything. Experimenting with how everything handles is interesting, like a smooth rolling beer keg or a floppy giant teddy bear. While ghosts are extremely powerful and mobile, they\u2019re also vulnerable to capture at any time. One minute you\u2019ll be triumphantly sliming all four busters and sabotaging their Proton Packs, and the next you\u2019ll be frantically mashing buttons to escape the pull of the streams and deadly traps. It\u2019s a delight to hear opponents\u2019 confusion while you stay out of sight, or their frustration as you cover the whole team in a whirlwind of slime.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>The classic firehouse serves as a multi-use hub when you\u2019re not actively in matches. A handful of cutscenes tell a basic story through the game's early hours. The narrative is nothing to get excited about, but hearing Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson reprising their roles as Ray and Winston is nice. As you level up, you find new cosmetics, gear parts that affect stats, collectibles, and contracts that reward special items and experience bumps. Daily and weekly jobs encourage you to check in regularly as well. I found the steady flow of goodies kept my group dashing to the lockers to try on a new shirt or silly glasses between jobs. And the gear upgrades feel tangible, especially when your particle thrower can let loose for longer without overheating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/10\/21\/1154d4a1\/cruiseship_-_pokey_nohud_-_010.png\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" alt=\"\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" \/>\n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>While the core gameplay is strong and engaging, I have concerns about Spirits Unleashed\u2019s long-term sustainability.
