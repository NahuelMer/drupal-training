Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet kick off the ninth generation of Pok\u00e9mon games, offering some of the biggest changes to date. An open world, four-player co-op, and other additions effectively push the series forward in meaningful ways, but the technical shortcomings often break immersion and temper an otherwise strong Pok\u00e9mon game.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Pok\u00e9mon formula remains mostly intact through Scarlet and Violet. Your main goals still involve catching, training, and battling the Pok\u00e9mon that inhabit the world. But this time, you do so in the series\u2019 first true open world, expanding the formula in unprecedented ways. The Paldea region is ripe for exploration, with diverse biomes and various nooks and crannies in which to hunt. Thanks to a wide swath of Pok\u00e9mon, new and old species alike, I always felt rewarded for journeying off the beaten path. When I did discover an all-new monster, I often appreciated the design, making this batch one of my favorite new generations in a long time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks to this open-world approach, most battles are now optional. Trainers occupy the world, but you must initiate the battle with them to start. I like this approach, as it let me skip fights I wouldn\u2019t otherwise want to be in, though the money, experience, and rewards often make them worthwhile. The same could be said of wild Pok\u00e9mon encounters, which only happen if you run into them; random encounters are completely gone this time around. You can also use the new Let\u2019s Go mechanic, where you send your lead Pok\u00e9mon out to auto-battle, if you\u2019re just looking for quick experience and crafting materials.<\/p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/players.brightcove.net\/694940074001\/rydylbNsz_default\/index.html?videoId=6315614256112\"><\/iframe>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the larger world comes at a cost, as Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet suffer from poor performance across the board. Characters pop in and out of existence before your eyes, textures appear in extremely low resolution, and the frame rate stutters around every turn. Game Freak shot for the stars with its first open world, but it\u2019s clear it still has a ways to go when it comes to making it work on Switch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you\u2019re in battle, longtime Pok\u00e9mon players will feel right at home, as it reverts to the traditional turn-based format where type strengths and weaknesses create compelling rock-paper-scissors-style matchups. The new Terastallization mechanic, where an in-battle Pok\u00e9mon takes on a gem-like appearance and boosts moves of its specific Tera Type, accentuates the type match-up system; some Pok\u00e9mon even change type when they\u2019re Terastallized. While the moves of the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s Tera Type are boosted, they\u2019re hardly overpowered, and since Terastallizing is limited to once per Pok\u00e9mon Center visit, it adds an extra layer of strategy. The Terastallized forms look uniformly goofy, but Terastallization is my favorite generational battle gimmick in series history.<\/p>\n\n<p>Players can explore this new, open Paldea region together thanks to four-player cooperative play. Once players join the host\u2019s instance, they can freely explore, catch new Pok\u00e9mon, battle in Tera Raids, and even trade with each other. I\u2019m sad there aren\u2019t more interactions between players in these sessions (you can\u2019t even watch battles unfold), but the freedom offered by co-op outweighs the shortcomings.<\/p>\n\n<p>The open-world design also enables you to choose the order in which you approach the three main questlines. Victory Road offers the series\u2019 traditional eight-gym conquest with the goal of taking down the Elite Four, while Starfall Street lets you attack bases held by Team Star, the rival group of this entry. Gym challenges preceding each leader battle diversify the lead up, but they\u2019re either mundane or revert to the traditional trainer-gauntlet style. Team Star base assaults are easy affairs, where you need to use the Let\u2019s Go mechanic to defeat 30 Pok\u00e9mon in 10 minutes before an often-challenging boss battle. Path of Legends, a third questline, grants engaging battles against huge Titan Pok\u00e9mon, provides the best rewards, and serves up a touching story. I enjoyed each individual questline, and while they\u2019re disparate in nature, they converge in the meaningful end and post-game content.<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/16\/6c854464\/pokemon_sv_screenshot_8.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/16\/8e9d3e09\/pokemon_scarlet_and_pokemon_violet_screenshot_18.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/16\/0a0e5344\/2.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/16\/318e6b51\/pokemon_sv_screenshot_10.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/16\/1d5570d7\/7.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/16\/e44c24fc\/pokemon_sv_screenshot_10-2.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/16\/6f2eee07\/15.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/16\/73a1f1d6\/pokemon_sv_screenshot_11.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/16\/cc0e3209\/pokemon_scarlet_and_pokemon_violet_screenshot_11.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/16\/af079bc9\/pokemon_sv_screenshot_15.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/16\/971feaf4\/pokemon_scarlet_and_pokemon_violet_screenshot_16.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/11\/16\/38c924bb\/pokemon_sv_screenshot_15-2.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          &nbsp;\n\n<p>Of course, the persistent mission of filling out your Pok\u00e9dex exists alongside those three story quests.
