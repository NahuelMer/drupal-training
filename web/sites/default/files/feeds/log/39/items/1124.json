You'll visit a forest, a beach, the bizarre Zen Zone modeled after a mythical, cherry-blossom-heavy Japan, and more as you follow the formula of entering new areas to explore and liberate. It\u2019s fun to sprint around with your soccer ball in each area, and it\u2019s rewarding to finally unlock a gate to a new zone. The zones never overstay their welcome before you\u2019re on to the next one.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/12\/15\/f5a4a99c\/ss6.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/12\/15\/b4abd190\/ss1.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/12\/15\/8d0226d0\/ss2.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/12\/15\/5eeb993e\/ss3.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/12\/15\/bcef641d\/ss4.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          &nbsp;\n\n<p>The incentive to continually explore and complete NPC&nbsp;missions is huge, but you never feel bogged down, nor do missions feel tedious;&nbsp;they\u2019re fun and quick to complete.

And some quests are downright weird; at one point in Zen Zone, the game turns into a turn-based RPG while fighting giant mushrooms.

Increasing your scoring chances requires whittling away at the keepers' shields, making charged shots important but opening you up to defensive maneuvers while stationary.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Even after pouring upgrades into my main character, goalkeepers deflected my best shots without breaking a sweat. Other times, a weak shot from across the field would effortlessly float into the goal. This lack of consistency is confusing and aggravating. Speed seems to be the only upgrade that matters, as most on-field upgrades don\u2019t feel impactful, and it\u2019s frustrating to lose a match after seemingly having an edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a sense of some control, but the matches can be so random it\u2019s off-putting. I found a good rhythm of shooting close and hammering home rebounds into the corners of the goal that was more tedious than fun, and I just wanted to be out of a match and back into the proper adventure. That\u2019s not a good sign for a soccer-based RPG. You also compete in numerous one-versus-one matches, but thanks to its basic formula, these felt more like padding than meaningful additions. The actual soccer portion of Soccer Story is just serviceable and frustratingly inconsistent, which is a bummer when compared to the rest of the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>While Soccer Story is a tale about the&nbsp;beautiful game, the soccer matches take a backseat to story and exploration. The adventure and role-playing aspect is a lot of fun, especially with soccer so integrated into the world, but the weak soccer matches keep it from truly being a great sports role-playing game. Buoyed by its charming and humorous premise, Soccer Story provides a satisfying adventure and a different type of soccer game, but one that doesn\u2019t quite score a hat-trick.<\/p>\n  \n\n    <h2>Score:\n    7.5<\/h2>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/scoring\" target=\"_blank\">About Game Informer's review system<\/a>\n  <\/p>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamestop.com\/search\/?q=Soccer%20Story\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button\">Purchase<\/a>","description":"\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n\n\n\n      <p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/12\/15\/eb13bce2\/ss5.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Soccer Story\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" \/><\/p>\n\n  <p>\n              <b>Reviewed on:<\/b>\n      Xbox Series X\/S\n      <br \/>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <b>Platform:<\/b>\n      PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X\/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC\n      <br \/>\n                  <b>Publisher:<\/b>\n      No More Robots\n      <br \/>\n              <b>Developer:<\/b>\n      PanicBarn\n      <br \/>\n              <\/p>\n\n      <p>Soccer Story is a charming role-playing adventure that seamlessly builds a joyous and often goofy story around something as simple as kicking a ball.
