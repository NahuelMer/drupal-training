Along the way, they unlock new weapons and abilities as they fight crystalline enemies in their quest to collect lost shards and earn powerful gear that bring them closer to escape. Across multiple runs, players choose different paths from rift to rift and develop an uneasy alliance with Fai, the strange, sardonic artificial intelligence whose spacecraft created the rifts.

                Fight together with your friends against hordes of enemies in this new Warhammer 40,000 experience. From the developers of the best-selling and award-winning co-op action franchise Vermintide, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is a visceral 4-player co-op action game set in the hive city of Tertium. In the depths of the hive, the seeds of corruption threaten an overwhelming tide of darkness. A heretical cult known as the Admonition seeks to seize control of the planet Atoma Prime and lay waste to its inhabitants. It is up to you and your allies in the Inquisition to root out the enemy before the city succumbs to Chaos. <p>Publisher: Fatshark<p>Release Date: Nov 30, 2022
