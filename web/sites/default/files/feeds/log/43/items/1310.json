As someone who hadn\u2019t played most of Shovel Knight\u2019s post-launch DLC, the last time I touched this series was nearly a decade ago. Gaining control of the titular character immediately felt familiar, and my old Shovel Knight habits returned to greet this new take on the series, led by developer Nitrome this time. The moment-to-moment experience plays excellently, in part because it\u2019s more Shovel Knight with some well-designed gameplay twists. However, the game\u2019s venture into roguelite territory feels inessential and so light-stepped that it didn\u2019t convince me it needed to be a part of this ever-expanding genre. Still, Shovel Knight Dig is more Shovel Knight, meaning retro-game and platforming enthusiasts will find great enjoyment throughout.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Rather than moving right through a beautifully pixelated stage, Dig tasks players with digging down, deeper and deeper into procedurally generated levels. This presents new feelings in the pantheon of emotions I feel while playing a Shovel Knight game: urgency and stress. Unlike many platformers out there, you can\u2019t take the time to observe where you must go and how best to get there. You have to keep digging down and while going back up a few spaces is possible, it\u2019s not easy. You\u2019re not meant to backtrack because your goal is far below you. If you miss some gems or one of the stage\u2019s three machine cogs, which unlock a special bonus reward, you probably missed your chance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/29\/7f47dd12\/screenshot_02.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/29\/00bbd8f7\/screenshot_03.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/29\/8f87822e\/screenshot_04.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/29\/77dd122b\/screenshot_05.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/29\/814ec275\/screenshot_06.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          &nbsp;\n\n<p>On top of that, if you spend too long in any one place, the antagonist Drill Knight will use a massive one-hit-kill excavation machine to bury you deeper into the Smeltworks, Secret Fountain, Grub Pit, or one of the game\u2019s other stages. I like this added stress to Dig\u2019s platforming, which largely feels identical to that of the original Shovel Knight game.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>After completing three stages in a given lair, you face a boss. I love these boss fights, but they\u2019re disappointing in the context of Dig. They feel like Shovel Knight bosses, fast-paced and fun, but they don\u2019t take advantage of the new mechanics specific to Dig. You jump around an arena attempting to damage a boss while dodging their attacks. Only the final boss implements the game\u2019s unique dig platforming mechanics and I wish this type of design was present in the multiple other opponents I faced before this one.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The hours I spent digging down through stage after stage, I rarely felt like I was playing a roguelite. It was only when I died and returned to above ground, which is where a camp of NPCs you\u2019ve met and shopkeepers reside, that I was reminded of the game\u2019s tip-toe into roguelite mechanics. You lose your stage progress and some of your gems upon death, but these losses are so minuscule that I never felt compelled to go out of my way to retrieve my lost currency in the next run.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/29\/da753b45\/screenshot_07.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/29\/b17efd69\/screenshot_08.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/29\/68bfb9ea\/screenshot_09.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/29\/ad8bf52e\/screenshot_10.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/29\/124f397a\/screenshot_01.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          &nbsp;\n\n<p>I also never felt the need to equip new sets of armor, which can only be purchased after finding templates of them in secret areas scattered throughout the various stages.
