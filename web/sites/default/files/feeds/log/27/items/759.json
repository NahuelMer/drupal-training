But while Return to Monkey Island is a sequel to Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge, Terrible Toybox isn't content to just let the game serve as an elaborate throwback to the earlier games.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/27\/6df22d61\/mi9.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/27\/b82ad57e\/mi7.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/27\/01742d2a\/mi6.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/27\/7fc3a0fd\/mi5.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/27\/0f011532\/mi1.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/27\/52dc6aa9\/mi2.jpg'><\/figure><figure><img src='https:\/\/www.gameinformer.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/body_default\/public\/2022\/09\/27\/25df5c0b\/mi3.jpg'><\/figure><\/section>\n          \u00a0\n\n<p>Notably, there's the game's refreshed art style.
